Text|Chapter
TAO can be talked about, but not the Eternal Tao.|1
Names can be named, but not the Eternal Name.|1
As the origin of heaven-and-earth, it is nameless:|1
As "the Mother" of all things, it is nameable.|1
So, as ever hidden, we should look at its inner essence:|1
As always manifest, we should look at its outer aspects.|1
These two flow from the same source, though differently named;|1
And both are called mysteries.|1
The Mystery of mysteries is the Door of all essence.|1
WHEN all the world recognises beauty as beauty, this in itself is ugliness.|2
When all the world recognises good as good, this in itself is evil.|2
Indeed, the hidden and the manifest give birth to each other.|2
Difficult and easy complement each other.|2
Long and short exhibit each other.|2
High and low set measure to each other.|2
Voice and sound harmonize each other.|2
Back and front follow each other.|2
Therefore, the Sage manages his affairs without ado,|2
And spreads his teaching without talking.|2
He denies nothing to the teeming things.|2
He rears them, but lays no claim to them.|2
He does his work, but sets no store by it.|2
He accomplishes his task, but does not dwell upon it.|2
And yet it is just because he does not dwell on it|2
That nobody can ever take it away from him.|2
BY not exalting the talented you will cause the people to cease from rivalry and contention.|3
By not prizing goods hard to get, you will cause the people to cease from robbing and stealing.|3
By not displaying what is desirable, you will cause the people's hearts to remain undisturbed.|3
Therefore, the Sage's way of governing begins by|3
Emptying the heart of desires,|3
Filling the belly with food,|3
Weakening the ambitions,|3
Toughening the bones.|3
In this way he will cause the people to remain without knowledge and without desire, and prevent the knowing ones from any ado.|3
Practice Non-Ado, and everything will be in order.|3
THE Tao is like an empty bowl,|4
Which in being used can never be filled up.|4
Fathomless, it seems to be the origin of all things.|4
It blunts all sharp edges,|4
It unties all tangles,|4
It harmonizes all lights,|4
It unites the world into one whole.|4
Hidden in the deeps,|4
Yet it seems to exist for ever.|4
I do not know whose child it is;|4
It seems to be the common ancestor of all, the father of things.|4
HEAVEN-and-Earth is not sentimental;|5
It treats all things as straw-dogs.|5
The Sage is not sentimental;|5
He treats all his people as straw-dogs.|5
Between Heaven and Earth,|5
There seems to be a Bellows:|5
It is empty, and yet it is inexhaustible;|5
The more it works, the more comes out of it.|5
No amount of words can fathom it:|5
Better look for it within you.|5
THE Spirit of the Fountain dies not.|6
It is called the Mysterious Feminine.|6
The Doorway of the Mysterious Feminine|6
Is called the Root of Heaven-and-Earth.|6
Lingering like gossamer, it has only a hint of existence;|6
And yet when you draw upon it, it is inexhaustible.|6
HEAVEN lasts long, and Earth abides.|7
What is the secret of their durability?|7
Is it not because they do not live for themselves|7
That they can live so long?|7
Therefore, the Sage wants to remain behind,|7
But finds himself at the head of others;|7
Reckons himself out,|7
But finds himself safe and secure.|7
Is it not because he is selfless|7
That his Self is realised?|7
THE highest form of goodness is like water.|8
Water knows how to benefit all things without striving with them.|8
It stays in places loathed by all men.|8
Therefore, it comes near the Tao.|8
In choosing your dwelling, know how to keep to the ground.|8
In cultivating your mind, know how to dive in the hidden deeps.|8
In dealing with others, know how to be gentle and kind.|8
In speaking, know how to keep your words.|8
In governing, know how to maintain order.|8
In transacting business, know how to be efficient.|8
In making a move, know how to choose the right moment.|8
If you do not strive with others,|8
You will be free from blame.|8
As for holding to fullness,|9
Far better were it to stop in time!|9
Keep on beating and sharpening a sword,|9
And the edge cannot be preserved for long.|9
Fill your house with gold and jade,|9
And it can no longer be guarded.|9
Set store by your riches and honour,|9
And you will only reap a crop of calamities.|9
Here is the Way of Heaven:|9
When you have done your work, retire!|9
IN keeping the spirit and the vital soul together,|10
Are you able to maintain their perfect harmony?|10
In gathering your vital energy to attain suppleness,|10
Have you reached the state of a new-bom babe?|10
In washing and clearing your inner vision,|10
Have you purified it of all dross?|10
In loving your people and governing your state,|10
Are you able to dispense with cleverness?|10
In the opening and shutting of heaven's gate,|10
Are you able to play the feminine part?|10
Enlightened and seeing far into all directions,|10
Can you at the same time remain detached and non-active?|10
Rear your people!|10
Feed your people!|10
Rear them without claiming them for your own!|10
Do your work without setting any store by it!|10
Be a leader, not a butcher!|10
This is called hidden Virtue.|10
THIRTY spokes converge upon a single hub;|11
It is on the hole in the center that the use of the cart hinges.|11
We make a vessel from a lump of clay;|11
It is the empty space within the vessel that makes it useful.|11
We make doors and windows for a room;|11
But it is these empty spaces that make the room livable.|11
Thus, while the tangible has advantages,|11
It is the intangible that makes it useful.|11
THE five colours blind the eye.|12
The five tones deafen the ear.|12
The five flavours cloy the palate.|12
Racing and hunting madden the mind.|12
Rare goods tempt men to do wrong.|12
Therefore, the Sage takes care of the belly, not the eye.|12
He prefers what is within to what is without.|12
"WELCOME disgrace as a pleasant surprise.|13
Prize calamities as your own body."|13
Why should we "welcome disgrace as a pleasant surprise"?|13
Because a lowly state is a boon:|13
Getting it is a pleasant surprise,|13
And so is losing it!|13
That is why we should "welcome disgrace as a pleasant surprise."|13
Why should we "prize calamities as our own body"?|13
Because our body is the very source of our calamities.|13
If we have no body, what calamities can we have?|13
Hence, only he who is willing to give his body for the sake of the world is fit to be entrusted with the world.|13
Only he who can do it with love is worthy of being the steward of the world.|13
LOOK at it but you cannot see it!|14
Its name is Formless.|14
Listen to it but you cannot hear it!|14
Its name is Soundless.|14
Grasp it but you cannot get it!|14
Its name is Incorporeal.|14
These three attributes are unfathomable;|14
Therefore they fuse into one.|14
Its upper side is not bright:|14
Its under side not dim.|14
Continually the Unnameable moves on,|14
Until it retums beyond the realm of things.|14
We call it the formless Form, the imageless Image.|14
We call it the indefinable and unimaginable.|14
Confront it and you do not see its face!|14
Follow it and you do not see its back!|14
Yet, equipped with this timeless Tao,|14
You can harness present realities.|14
To know the origins is initiation into the Tao.|14
THE ancient adepts of the Tao were subtle and flexible, profound and comprehensive.|15
Their minds were too deep to be fathomed.|15
Because they are unfathomable,|15
One can only describe them vaguely by their appearance.|15
Hesitant like one wading a stream in winter;|15
Timid like one afraid of his neighbours on all sides;|15
Cautious and courteous like a guest;|15
Yielding like ice on the point of melting;|15
Simple like an uncarved block;|15
Hollow like a cave;|15
Confused like a muddy pool;|15
And yet who else could quietly and gradually evolve from the muddy to the clear?|15
Who else could slowly but steadily move from the inert to the living?|15
He who keeps the Tao does not want to be full.|15
But precisely because he is never full,|15
He can always remain like a hidden sprout,|15
And does not rush to early ripening.|15
ATTAIN to utmost Emptiness.|16
Cling single-heartedly to interior peace.|16
While all things are stirring together,|16
I only contemplate the Return.|16
For flourishing as they do,|16
Each of them will return to its root.|16
To return to the root is to find peace.|16
To find peace is to fulfill one's destiny.|16
To fulfill one's destiny is to be constant.|16
To know the Constant is called Insight.|16
If one does not know the Constant,|16
One runs blindly into disasters.|16
If one knows the Constant,|16
One can understand and embrace all.|16
If one understands and embraces all,|16
One is capable of doing justice.|16
To be just is to be kingly;|16
To be kingly is to be heavenly;|16
To be heavenly is to be one with the Tao;|16
To be one with the Tao is to abide forever.|16
Such a one will be safe and whole|16
Even after the dissolution of his body.|16
THE highest type of ruler is one of whose existence the people are barely aware.|17
Next comes one whom they love and praise.|17
Next comes one whom they fear.|17
Next comes one whom they despise and defy.|17
When you are lacking in faith,|17
Others will be unfaithful to you.|17
The Sage is self-effacing and scanty of words.|17
When his task is accomplished and things have been completed,|17
All the people say, "We ourselves have achieved it!"|17
WHEN the Great Tao was abandoned,|18
There appeared humanity and justice.|18
When intelligence and wit arose,|18
There appeared great hypocrites.|18
When the six relations lost their harmony,|18
There appeared filial piety and paternal kindness.|18
When darkness and disorder began to reign in a kingdom,|18
There appeared the loyal ministers.|18
DROP wisdom, abandon cleverness,|19
And the people will be benefited a hundredfold.|19
Drop humanity, abandon justice,|19
And the people will return to their natural affections.|19
Drop shrewdness, abandon sharpness,|19
And robbers and thieves will cease to be.|19
These three are the criss-cross of Tao,|19
And are not sufficient in themselves.|19
Therefore, they should be subordinated|19
To a Higher principle:|19
See the Simple and embrace the Primal,|19
Diminish the self and curb the desires!|19
HAVE done with learning,|20
And you will have no more vexation.|20
How great is the difference between "eh" and "o"?|20
What is the distinction between "good" and "evil"?|20
Must I fear what others fear?|20
What abysmal nonsense this is!|20
All men are joyous and beaming,|20
As though feasting upon a sacrificial ox,|20
As though mounting the Spring Terrace;|20
I alone am placid and give no sign,|20
Like a babe which has not yet smiled.|20
I alone am forlorn as one who has no home to retum to.|20
All men have enough and to spare:|20
I alone appear to possess nothing.|20
What a fool I am!|20
What a muddled mind I have!|20
All men are bright, bright:|20
I alone am dim, dim.|20
All men are sharp, sharp:|20
I alone am mum, mum!|20
Bland like the ocean,|20
Aimless like the wafting gale.|20
All men settle down in their grooves:|20
I alone am stubborn and remain outside.|20
But wherein I am most different from others is|20
In knowing to take sustenance from my Mother!|20
IT lies in the nature of Grand Virtue|21
To follow the Tao and the Tao alone.|21
Now what is the Tao?|21
It is Something elusive and evasive.|21
Evasive and elusive!|21
And yet It contains within Itself a Form.|21
Elusive and evasive!|21
And yet It contains within Itself a Substance.|21
Shadowy and dim!|21
And yet It contains within Itself a Core of Vitality.|21
The Core of Vitality is very real,|21
It contains within Itself an unfailing Sincerity.|21
Throughout the ages Its Name has been preserved|21
In order to recall the Beginning of all things.|21
How do I know the ways of all things at the Beginning?|21
By what is within me.|21
BEND and you will be whole.|22
Curl and you will be straight.|22
Keep empty and you will be filled.|22
Grow old and you will be renewed.|22
Have little and you will gain.|22
Have much and you will be confused.|22
Therefore, the Sage embraces the One,|22
And becomes a Pattern to all under Heaven.|22
He does not make a show of himself,|22
Hence he shines;|22
Does not justify himself,|22
Hence he becomes known;|22
Does not boast of his ability,|22
Hence he gets his credit;|22
Does not brandish his success,|22
Hence he endures;|22
Does not compete with anyone,|22
Hence no one can compete with him.|22
Indeed, the ancient saying: "Bend and you will remain whole" is no idle word.|22
Nay, if you have really attained wholeness, everything will flock to you.|22
ONLY simple and quiet words will ripen of themselves.|23
For a whirlwind does not last a whole morning,|23
Nor does a sudden shower last a whole day.|23
Who is their author? Heaven-and-Earth!|23
Even Heaven-and-Earth cannot make such violent things last long;|23
How much truer is it of the rash endeavours of men?|23
Hence, he who cultivates the Tao is one with the Tao;|23
He who practices Virtue is one with Virtue;|23
And he who courts after Loss is one with Loss.|23
To be one with the Tao is to be a welcome accession to the Tao;|23
To be one with Virtue is to be a welcome accession to Virtue;|23
To be one with Loss is to be a welcome accession to Loss.|23
Deficiency of faith on your part|23
Entails faithlessness on the part of others.|23
ONE on tip-toe cannot stand.|24
One astride cannot walk.|24
One who displays himself does not shine.|24
One who justifies himself has no glory.|24
One who boasts of his own ability has no merit.|24
One who parades his own success will not endure.|24
In Tao these things are called "unwanted food and extraneous growths,"|24
Which are loathed by all things.|24
Hence, a man of Tao does not set his heart upon them.|24
THERE was Something undefined and yet complete in itself,|25
Born before Heaven-and-Earth.|25
Silent and boundless,|25
Standing alone without change,|25
Yet pervading all without fail,|25
It may be regarded as the Mother of the world.|25
I do not know its name;|25
I style it "Tao";|25
And, in the absence of a better word, call it "The Great."|25
To be great is to go on,|25
To go on is to be far,|25
To be far is to return.|25
Hence, "Tao is great,|25
Heaven is great,|25
Earth is great,|25
King is great."|25
Thus, the king is one of the great four in the Universe.|25
Man follows the ways of the Earth.|25
The Earth follows the ways of Heaven,|25
Heaven follows the ways of Tao,|25
Tao follows its own ways.|25
HEAVINESS is the root of lightness.|26
Serenity is the master of restlessness.|26
Therefore, the Sage, travelling all day,|26
Does not part with the baggage-wagon;|26
Though there may be gorgeous sights to see,|26
He stays at ease in his own home.|26
Why should a lord of ten thousand chariots|26
Display his lightness to the world?|26
To be light is to be separated from one's root;|26
To be restless is to lose one's self-mastery.|26
GOOD walking leaves no track behind it;|27
Good speech leaves no mark to be picked at;|27
Good calculation makes no use of counting-slips;|27
Good shutting makes no use of bolt and bar,|27
And yet nobody can undo it;|27
Good tying makes no use of rope and knot,|27
And yet nobody can untie it.|27
Hence, the Sage is always good at saving men,|27
And therefore nobody is abandoned;|27
Always good at saving things,|27
And therefore nothing is wasted.|27
This is called "following the guidance of the Inner Light."|27
Hence, good men are teachers of bad men,|27
While bad men are the charge of good men.|27
Not to revere one's teacher,|27
Not to cherish one's charge,|27
Is to be on the wrong road, however intelligent one may be.|27
This is an essential tenet of the Tao.|27
KNOW the masculine,|28
Keep to the feminine,|28
And be the Brook of the World.|28
To be the Brook of the World is|28
To move constantly in the path of Virtue|28
Without swerving from it,|28
And to return again to infancy.|28
Know the white,|28
Keep to the black,|28
And be the Pattern of the World.|28
To be the Pattern of the World is|28
To move constantly in the path of Virtue|28
Without erring a single step,|28
And to return again to the Infinite.|28
Know the glorious,|28
Keep to the lowly,|28
And be the Fountain of the World.|28
To be the Fountain of the World is|28
To live the abundant life of Virtue,|28
And to return again to Primal Simplicity.|28
When Primal Simplicity diversifies,|28
It becomes useful vessels,|28
Which, in the hands of the Sage, become officers.|28
Hence, "a great tailor does little cutting."|28
DOES anyone want to take the world and do what he wants with it?|29
I do not see how he can succeed.|29
The world is a sacred vessel, which must not be tampered with or grabbed after.|29
To tamper with it is to spoil it, and to grasp it is to lose it.|29
In fact, for all things there is a time for going ahead, and a time for following behind;|29
A time for slow-breathing and a time for fast-breathing;|29
A time to grow in strength and a time to decay;|29
A time to be up and a time to be down.|29
Therefore, the Sage avoids all extremes, excesses and extravagances.|29
HE who knows how to guide a ruler in the path of Tao|30
Does not try to override the world with force of arms.|30
It is in the nature of a military weapon to turn against its wielder.|30
Wherever armies are stationed; thorny bushes grow.|30
After a great war, bad years invariably follow.|30
What you want is to protect efficiently your own state,|30
But not to aim at self-aggrandisement.|30
After you have attained your purpose,|30
You must not parade your success,|30
You must not boast of your ability,|30
You must not feel proud,|30
You must rather regret that you had not been able to prevent the war.|30
You must never think of conquering others by force.|30
For to be over-developed is to hasten decay,|30
And this is against Tao,|30
And what is against Tao will soon cease to be.|30
FINE weapons of war augur evil.|31
Even things seem to hate them.|31
Therefore, a man of Tao does not set his heart upon them.|31
In ordinary life, a gentleman regards the left side as the place of honour:|31
In war, the right side is the place of honour.|31
As weapons are instruments of evil,|31
They are not properly a gentleman's instruments;|31
Only on necessity will he resort to them.|31
For peace and quiet are dearest to his heart,|31
And to him even a victory is no cause for rejoicing.|31
To rejoice over a victory is to rejoice over the slaughter of men!|31
Hence a man who rejoices over the slaughter of men cannot expect to thrive in the world of men.|31
On happy occasions the left side is preferred:|31
On sad occasions the right side.|31
In the army, the Lieutenant Commander stands on the left,|31
While the Commander-in-Chief stands on the right.|31
This means that war is treated on a par with a funeral service.|31
Because many people have been killed, it is only right that survivors should mourn for them.|31
Hence, even a victory is a funeral.|31
TAO is always nameless.|32
Small as it is in its Primal Simplicity,|32
It is inferior to nothing in the world.|32
If only a ruler could cling to it,|32
Everything will render homage to him.|32
Heaven and Earth will be harmonized|32
And send down sweet dew.|32
Peace and order will reign among the people|32
Without any command from above.|32
When once the Primal Simplicity diversified,|32
Different names appeared.|32
Are there not enough names now?|32
Is this not the time to stop?|32
To know when to stop is to preserve ourselves from danger.|32
The Tao is to the world what a great river or an ocean is to the streams and brooks.|32
HE who knows men is clever;|33
He who knows himself has insight.|33
He who conquers men has force;|33
He who conquers himself is truly strong.|33
He who knows when he has got enough is rich,|33
And he who adheres assiduously to the path of Tao is a man of steady purpose.|33
He who stays where he has found his true home endures long,|33
And he who dies but perishes not enjoys real longevity.|33
THE Great Tao is universal like a flood.|34
How can it be turned to the right or to the left?|34
All creatures depend on it,|34
And it denies nothing to anyone.|34
It does its work,|34
But it makes no claims for itself.|34
It clothes and feeds all,|34
But it does not lord it over them:|34
Thus, it may be called "the Little."|34
All things return to it as to their home,|34
But it does not lord it over them:|34
Thus, it may be called "the Great."|34
It is just because it does not wish to be great|34
That its greatness is fully realised.|34
HE who holds the Great Symbol will attract all things to him.|35
They flock to him and receive no harm, for in him they find peace, security and happiness.|35
Music and dainty dishes can only make a passing guest pause.|35
But the words of Tao possess lasting effects,|35
Though they are mild and flavourless,|35
Though they appeal neither to the eye nor to the ear.|35
WHAT is in the end to be shrunken,|36
Begins by being first stretched out.|36
What is in the end to be weakened,|36
Begins by being first made strong.|36
What is in the end to be thrown down,|36
Begins by being first set on high.|36
What is in the end to be despoiled,|36
Begins by being first richly endowed.|36
Herein is the subtle wisdom of life:|36
The soft and weak overcomes the hard and strong.|36
Just as the fish must not leave the deeps,|36
So the ruler must not display his weapons.|36
TAO never makes any ado,|37
And yet it does everything.|37
If a ruler can cling to it,|37
All things will grow of themselves.|37
When they have grown and tend to make a stir,|37
It is time to keep them in their place by the aid of the nameless Primal Simplicity,|37
Which alone can curb the desires of men.|37
When the desires of men are curbed, there will be peace,|37
And the world will settle down of its own accord.|37
HIGH Virtue is non-virtuous;|38
Therefore it has Virtue.|38
Low Virtue never frees itself from virtuousness;|38
Therefore it has no Virtue.|38
High Virtue makes no fuss and has no private ends to serve:|38
Low Virtue not only fusses but has private ends to serve.|38
High humanity fusses but has no private ends to serve:|38
High morality not only fusses but has private ends to serve.|38
High ceremony fusses but finds no response;|38
Then it tries to enforce itself with rolled-up sleeves.|38
Failing Tao, man resorts to Virtue.|38
Failing Virtue, man resorts to humanity.|38
Failing humanity, man resorts to morality.|38
Failing morality, man resorts to ceremony.|38
Now, ceremony is the merest husk of faith and loyalty;|38
It is the beginning of all confusion and disorder.|38
As to foreknowledge, it is only the flower of Tao,|38
And the beginning of folly.|38
Therefore, the full-grown man sets his heart upon the substance rather than the husk;|38
Upon the fruit rather than the flower.|38
Truly, he prefers what is within to what is without.|38
FROM of old there are not lacking things that have attained Oneness.|39
The sky attained Oneness and became clear;|39
The earth attained Oneness and became calm;|39
The spirits attained Oneness and became charged with mystical powers;|39
The fountains attained Oneness and became full;|39
The ten thousand creatures attained Oneness and became reproductive;|39
Barons and princes attained Oneness and became sovereign rulers of the world.|39
All of them are what they are by virtue of Oneness.|39
If the sky were not clear, it would be likely to fall to pieces;|39
If the earth were not calm, it would be likely to burst into bits;|39
If the spirits were not charged with mystical powers, they would be likely to cease from being;|39
If the fountains were not full, they would be likely to dry up;|39
If the ten thousand creatures were not reproductive, they would be likely to come to extinction;|39
If the barons and princes were not the sovereign rulers, they would be likely to stumble and fall.|39
Truly, humility is the root from which greatness springs,|39
And the high must be built upon the foundation of the low.|39
That is why barons and princes style themselves "The Helpless One," "The Little One," and "The Worthless One."|39
THE movement of the Tao consists in Returning.|40
The use of the Tao consists in softness.|40
All things under heaven are born of the corporeal:|40
The corporeal is born of the Incorporeal.|40
WHEN a wise scholar hears the Tao,|41
He practises it diligently.|41
When a mediocre scholar hears the Tao,|41
He wavers between belief and unbelief.|41
When a worthless scholar hears the Tao,|41
He laughs boisterously at it.|41
But if such a one does not laugh at it,|41
The Tao would not be the Tao!|41
The wise men of old have truly said:|41
The bright Way looks dim.|41
The progressive Way looks retrograde.|41
The smooth Way looks rugged.|41
High Virtue looks like an abyss.|41
Great whiteness looks spotted.|41
Abundant Virtue looks deficient.|41
Established Virtue looks shabby.|41
Solid Virtue looks as though melted.|41
Great squareness has no corners.|41
Great talents ripen late.|41
Great sound is silent.|41
Great Form is shapeless.|41
The Tao is hidden and nameless;|41
Yet it alone knows how to render help and to fulfill.|41
TAO gave birth to One,|42
One gave birth to Two,|42
Two gave birth to Three,|42
Three gave birth to all the myriad things.|42
All the myriad things carry the Yin on their backs and hold the Yang in their embrace,|42
Deriving their vital harmony from the proper blending of the two vital Breaths.|42
What is more loathed by men than to be "helpless," "little," and "worthless"?|42
And yet these are the very names the princes and barons call themselves.|42
Truly, one may gain by losing;|42
And one may lose by gaining.|42
What another has taught let me repeat:|42
"A man of violence will come to a violent end."|42
Whoever said this can be my teacher and my father.|42
THE softest of all things|43
Overrides the hardest of all things.|43
Only Nothing can enter into no-space.|43
Hence I know the advantages of Non-Ado.|43
Few things under heaven are as instructive as the lessons of Silence,|43
Or as beneficial as the fruits of Non-Ado.|43
As for your name and your body, which is the dearer?|44
As for your body and your wealth, which is the more to be prized?|44
As for gain and loss, which is the more painful?|44
Thus, an excessive love for anything will cost you dear in the end.|44
The storing up of too much goods will entail a heavy loss.|44
To know when you have enough is to be immune from disgrace.|44
To know when to stop is to be preserved from perils.|44
Only thus can you endure long.|44
THE greatest perfection seems imperfect,|45
And yet its use is inexhaustible.|45
The greatest fullness seems empty,|45
And yet its use is endless.|45
The greatest straightness looks like crookedness.|45
The greatest skill appears clumsy.|45
The greatest eloquence sounds like stammering.|45
Restlessness overcomes cold,|45
But calm overcomes heat.|45
The peaceful and serene|45
Is the Norm of the World.|45
WHEN the world is in possession of the Tao,|46
The galloping horses are led to fertilize the fields with their droppings.|46
When the world has become Taoless,|46
War horses breed themselves on the suburbs.|46
There is no calamity like not knowing what is enough.|46
There is no evil like covetousness.|46
Only he who knows what is enough will always have enough.|46
WITHOUT going out of your door,|47
You can know the ways of the world.|47
Without peeping through your window,|47
You can see the Way of Heaven.|47
The farther you go,|47
The less you know.|47
Thus, the Sage knows without travelling,|47
Sees vithout looking,|47
And achieves without Ado.|47
LEARNING consists in daily accumulating;|48
The practice of Tao consists in daily diminishing.|48
Keep on diminishing and diminishing,|48
Until you reach the state of Non-Ado.|48
No-Ado, and yet nothing is left undone.|48
To win the world, one must renounce all.|48
If one still has private ends to serve,|48
One will never be able to win the world.|48
THE Sage has no interests of his own,|49
But takes the interests of the people as his own.|49
He is kind to the kind;|49
He is also kind to the unkind:|49
For Virtue is kind.|49
He is faithful to the faithful;|49
He is also faithful to the unfaithful:|49
For Virtue is faithful.|49
In the midst of the world, the Sage is shy and self-effacing.|49
For the sake of the world he keeps his heart in its nebulous state.|49
All the people strain their ears and eyes:|49
The Sage only smiles like an amused infant.|49
WHEN one is out of Life, one is in Death. The|50
companions of life are thirteen; the companions|50
of Death are thirteen; and, when a living person moves|50
into the Realm of Death, his companions are also thir-|50
teen. How is this? Because he draws upon the resources|50
of Life too heavily.|50
It is said that he who knows well how to live meets|50
no tigers or wild buffaloes on his road, and comes out|50
from the battle-ground untouched by the weapons of|50
war. For, in him, a buffalo would find no butt for his|50
horns, a tiger nothing to lay his claws upon, and a|50
weapon of war no place to admit its point. How is this?|50
Because there is no room for Death in him.|50
TAO gives them life,|51
Virtue nurses them,|51
Matter shapes them,|51
Environment perfects them.|51
Therefore all things without exception worship Tao and do homage to Virtue.|51
They have not been commanded to worship Tao and do homage to Virtue,|51
But they always do so spontaneously.|51
It is Tao that gives them life:|51
It is Virtue that nurses them, grows them, fosters them, shelters them, comforts them, nourishes them, and covers them under her wings.|51
To give life but to claim nothing,|51
To do your work but to set no store by it,|51
To be a leader, not a butcher,|51
This is called hidden Virtue.|51
ALL-under-Heaven have a common Beginning.|52
This Beginning is the Mother of the world.|52
Having known the Mother,|52
We may proceed to know her children.|52
Having known the children,|52
We should go back and hold on to the Mother.|52
In so doing, you will incur no risk|52
Even though your body be annihilated.|52
Block all the passages!|52
Shut all the doors!|52
And to the end of your days you will not be worn out.|52
Open the passages!|52
Multiply your activities!|52
And to the end of your days you will remain helpless.|52
To see the small is to have insight.|52
To hold on to weakness is to be strong.|52
Use the lights, but return to your insight.|52
Do not bring calamities upon yourself.|52
This is the way of cultivating the Changeless.|52
IF only I had the tiniest grain of wisdom,|53
I should walk in the Great Way,|53
And my only fear would be to stray from it.|53
The Great Way is very smooth and straight;|53
And yet the people prefer devious paths.|53
The court is very clean and well garnished,|53
But the fields are very weedy and wild,|53
And the granaries are very empty!|53
They wear gorgeous clothes,|53
They carry sharp swords,|53
They surfeit themselves with food and drink,|53
They possess more riches than they can use!|53
They are the heralds of brigandage!|53
As for Tao, what do they know about it?|53
WHAT is well planted cannot be uprooted.|54
What is well embraced cannot slip away.|54
Your descendants will carry on the ancestral sacrifice for generations without end.|54
Cultivate Virtue in your own person,|54
And it becomes a genuine part of you.|54
Cultivate it in the family,|54
And it will abide.|54
Cultivate it in the community,|54
And it will live and grow.|54
Cultivate it in the state,|54
And it will flourish abundantly.|54
Cultivate it in the world,|54
And it vill become universal.|54
Hence, a person must be judged as person;|54
A family as family;|54
A community as community;|54
A state as state;|54
The world as world.|54
How do I know about the world?|54
By what is within me.|54
ONE who is steeped in Virtue is akin to the new-born babe.|55
Wasps and poisonous serpents do not sting it,|55
Nor fierce beasts seize it,|55
Nor birds of prey maul it.|55
Its bones are tender, its sinews soft,|55
But its grip is firm.|55
It has not known the union of the male and the female,|55
Growing in its wholeness, and keeping its vitality in its perfect integrity.|55
It howls and screams all day long without getting hoarse,|55
Because it embodies perfect harmony.|55
To know harmony is to know the Changeless.|55
To know the Changeless is to have insight.|55
To hasten the growth of life is ominous.|55
To control the breath by the will is to overstrain it.|55
To be overgrown is to decay.|55
All this is against Tao,|55
And whatever is against Tao soon ceases to be.|55
HE who knows does not speak.|56
He who speaks does not know.|56
Block all the passages!|56
Shut all the doors!|56
Blunt all edges!|56
Untie all tangles!|56
Harmonize all lights!|56
Unite the world into one whole!|56
This is called the Mystical Whole,|56
Which you cannot court after nor shun,|56
Benefit nor harm, honour nor humble.|56
Therefore, it is the Highest of the world.|56
You govern a kingdom by normal rules;|57
You fight a war by exceptional moves;|57
But you win the world by letting alone.|57
How do I know that this is so?|57
By what is within me!|57
The more taboos and inhibitions there are in the world,|57
The poorer the people become.|57
The sharper the weapons the people possess,|57
The greater confusion reigns in the realm.|57
The more clever and crafty the men,|57
The oftener strange things happen.|57
The more articulate the laws and ordinances,|57
The more robbers and thieves arise.|57
Therefore, the Sage says:|57
I do not make any fuss, and the people transform themselves.|57
I love quietude, and the people settle down in their regular grooves.|57
I do not engage myself in anything, and the people grow rich.|57
I have no desires, and the people return to Simplicity.|57
WHERE the ruler is mum, mum,|58
The people are simple and happy.|58
Where the ruler is sharp, sharp,|58
The people are wily and discontented.|58
Bad fortune is what good fortune leans on,|58
Good fortune is what bad fortune hides in.|58
Who knows the ultimate end of this process?|58
Is there no norm of right?|58
Yet what is normal soon becomes abnormal,|58
And what is auspicious soon turns ominous.|58
Long indeed have the people been in a quandary.|58
Therefore, the Sage squares without cutting, carves vfithout disfiguring, straightens without straining, enlightens without dazzling.|58
IN governing a people and in serving Heaven,|59
There is nothing like frugality.|59
To be frugal is to return before straying.|59
To return before straying is to have a double reserve of virtue.|59
To have a double reserve of virtue is to overcome everything.|59
To overcome everything is to reach an invisible height.|59
Only he who has reached an invisible height can have a kingdom.|59
Only he who has got the Mother of a kingdom can last long.|59
This is the way to be deep-rooted and firm-planted in the Tao,|59
The secret of long life and lasting vision.|59
RULING a big kingdom is like cooking a small fish.|60
When a man of Tao reigns over the world, demons|60
have no spiritual powers. Not that the demons have no|60
spiritual powers, but the spirits themselves do no harm|60
to men. Not that the spirits do no harm to men, but the|60
Sage himself does no harm to his people. If only the|60
ruler and his people would refrain from harming each|60
other, all the benefits of life would accumulate in the|60
kingdom.|60
A GREAT country is like the lowland toward which all|61
streams flow. It is the Reservoir of all under heaven,|61
the Feminine of the world. The Feminine always conquers the Masculine by her|61
quietness, by lowering herself through her quietness. Hence, if a great country can lower itself before a|61
small country, it will win over the small country; and if a|61
small country can lower itself before a great country, it|61
will win over the great country. The one wins by|61
stooping; the other, by remaining low. What a great country wants is simply to embrace|61
more people; and what a small country wants is simply|61
to come to serve its patron. Thus, each gets what it|61
wants. But it behooves a great country to lower itself.|61
THE Tao is the hidden Reservoir of all things.|62
A treasure to the honest, it is a safeguard to the erring.|62
A good word will find its own market.|62
A good deed may be used as a gift to another.|62
That a man is straying from the right path|62
Is no reason that he should be cast away.|62
Hence, at the Enthronement of an Emperor,|62
Or at the Installation of the Three Ministers,|62
Let others offer their discs of jade, following it up with teams of horses;|62
It is better for you to offer the Tao without moving your feet!|62
Why did the ancients prize the Tao?|62
Is it not because by virtue of it he who seeks finds,|62
And the guilty are forgiven?|62
That is why it is such a treasure to the world.|62
DO the Non-Ado.|63
Strive for the effortless.|63
Savour the savourless.|63
Exalt the low.|63
Multiply the few.|63
Requite injury with kindness.|63
Nip troubles in the bud.|63
Sow the great in the small.|63
Difficult things of the world|63
Can only be tackled when they are easy.|63
Big things of the world|63
Can only be achieved by attending to their small beginnings.|63
Thus, the Sage never has to grapple with big things,|63
Yet he alone is capable of achieving them!|63
He who promises lightly must be lacking in faith.|63
He who thinks everything easy will end by finding everything difficult.|63
Therefore, the Sage, who regards everything as difficult,|63
Meets with no difficulties in the end.|63
WHAT is at rest is easy to hold.|64
What manifests no omens is easily forestalled.|64
What is fragile is easily shattered.|64
What is small is easily scattered.|64
Tackle things before they have appeared.|64
Cultivate peace and order before confusion and disorder have set in.|64
A tree as big as a man's embrace springs from a tiny sprout.|64
A tower nine stories high begins with a heap of earth.|64
A journey of a thousand leagues starts from where your feet stand.|64
He who fusses over anything spoils it.|64
He who grasps anything loses it.|64
The Sage fusses over nothing and therefore spoils nothing.|64
He grips at nothing and therefore loses nothing.|64
In handling affairs, people often spoil them just at the point of success.|64
With heedfulness in the beginning and patience at the end, nothing will be spoiled.|64
Therefore, the Sage desires to be desireless,|64
Sets no value on rare goods,|64
Learns to unlearn his learning,|64
And induces the masses to return from where they have overpassed.|64
He only helps all creatures to find their own nature,|64
But does not venture to lead them by the nose.|64
IN the old days, those who were well versed in the|65
practice of the Tao did not try to enlighten the|65
people, but rather to keep them in the state of simplicity.|65
For, why are the people hard to govern? Because they|65
are too clever! Therefore, he who governs his state|65
with cleverness is its malefactor; but he who governs|65
his state without resorting to cleverness is its|65
benefactor. To know these principles is to possess a|65
rule and a measure. To keep the rule and the measure|65
constantly in your mind is what we call Mystical|65
Virtue. Deep and far-reaching is Mystical Virtue! It|65
leads all things to return, till they come back to Great|65
Harmony!|65
HOW does the sea become the king of all streams?|66
Because it lies lower than they!|66
Hence it is the king of all streams.|66
Therefore, the Sage reigns over the people by humbling himself in speech;|66
And leads the people by putting himself behind.|66
Thus it is that when a Sage stands above the people, they do not feel the heaviness of his weight;|66
And when he stands in front of the people, they do not feel hurt.|66
Therefore all the world is glad to push him forward without getting tired of him.|66
Just because he strives with nobody,|66
Nobody can ever strive with him.|66
ALL the world says that my Tao is great, but seems|67
queer, like nothing on earth. But it is just because|67
my Tao is great that it is like nothing on earth! If it were|67
like anything on earth, how small it would have been|67
from the very beginning!|67
I have Three Treasures, which I hold fast and watch|67
over closely. The first is Mercy. The second is Frugality.|67
The third is Not Daring to Be First in the World. Because|67
I am merciful, therefore I can be brave. Because I am|67
frugal, therefore I can be generous. Because I dare not|67
be first, therefore I can be the chief of all vessels.|67
If a man wants to be brave without first being|67
merciful, generous without first being frugal, a leader|67
without first wishing to follow, he is only courting|67
death!|67
Mercy alone can help you to win a war. Mercy alone|67
can help you to defend your state. For Heaven will|67
come to the rescue of the merciful, and protect him|67
with its Mercy.|67
A GOOD soldier is never aggressive;|68
A good fighter is never angry.|68
The best way of conquering an enemy|68
Is to win him over by not antagonising him.|68
The best way of employing a man|68
Is to serve under him.|68
This is called the virtue of non-striving!|68
This is called using the abilities of men!|68
This is called being wedded to Heaven as of old!|68
THE strategists have a saying: I dare not be a host, but rather a guest; I dare not advance an inch, but rather retreat a foot.|69
This is called marching without moving,|69
Rolling up one's sleeves without baring one's arms,|69
Capturing the enemy without confronting him,|69
Holding a weapon that is invisible.|69
There is no greater calamity than to under-estimate the strength of your enemy.|69
For to under-estimate the strength of your enemy is to lose your treasure.|69
Therefore, when opposing troops meet in battle, victory belongs to the grieving side.|69
MY words are very easy to understand, and very easy to practise:|70
But the world cannot understand them, nor practise them.|70
My words have an Ancestor.|70
My deeds have a Lord.|70
The people have no knowledge of this.|70
Therefore, they have no knowledge of me.|70
The fewer persons know me,|70
The nobler are they that follow me.|70
Therefore, the Sage wears coarse clothes,|70
While keeping the jade in his bosom.|70
To realize that our knowledge is ignorance,|71
This is a noble insight.|71
To regard our ignorance as knowledge,|71
This is mental sickness.|71
Only when we are sick of our sickness|71
Shall we cease to be sick.|71
The Sage is not sick, being sick of sickness;|71
This is the secret of health.|71
WHEN the people no longer fear your power,|72
It is a sign that a greater power is coming.|72
Interfere not lightly vith their dwelling,|72
Nor lay heavy burdens upon their livelihood.|72
Only when you cease to weary them,|72
They will cease to be wearied of you.|72
Therefore, the Sage knows himself,|72
But makes no show of himself,|72
Loves himself,|72
But does not exalt himself.|72
He prefers what is within to what is without.|72
HE who is brave in daring will be killed;|73
He who is brave in not daring will survive.|73
Of these two kinds of bravery, one is beneficial, while the other proves harmful.|73
Some things are detested by Heaven,|73
But who knows the reason?|73
Even the Sage is baffled by such a question.|73
It is Heaven's Way to conquer without striving,|73
To get responses without speaking,|73
To induce the people to come without summoning,|73
To act according to plans without haste.|73
Vast is Heaven's net;|73
Sparse-meshed it is, and yet|73
Nothing can slip through it.|73
WHEN the people are no longer afraid of death,|74
Why scare them with the spectre of death?|74
If you could make the people always afraid of death,|74
And they still persisted in breaking the law,|74
Then you might with reason arrest and execute them,|74
And who would dare to break the law?|74
Is not the Great Executor always there to kill?|74
To do the killing for the Great Executor|74
Is to chop wood for a master carpenter,|74
And you would be lucky indeed if you did not hurt your own hand!|74
WHY are the people starving?|75
Because those above them are taxing them too heavily.|75
That is why they are starving.|75
Why are the people hard to manage?|75
Because those above them are fussy and have private ends to serve.|75
That is why they are hard to manage.|75
Why do the people make light of death?|75
Because those above them make too much of life.|75
That is why they make light of death.|75
The people have simply nothing to live upon!|75
They know better than to value such a life!|75
WHEN a man is living, he is soft and supple.|76
When he is dead, he becomes hard and rigid.|76
When a plant is living, it is soft and tender.|76
When it is dead, it becomes withered and dry.|76
Hence, the hard and rigid belongs to the company of the dead:|76
The soft and supple belongs to the company of the living.|76
Therefore, a mighty army tends to fall by its own weight,|76
Just as dry wood is ready for the axe.|76
The mighty and great will be laid low;|76
The humbie and weak will be exalted.|76
PERHAPS the Way of Heaven may be likened to the|77
stretching of a composite bow! The upper part is|77
depressed, while the lower is raised. If the bow-string is|77
too long, it is cut short: if too short, it is added to.|77
The Way of Heaven diminishes the more-than-|77
enough to supply the less-than-enough. The way of|77
man is different: it takes from the less-than-enough to|77
swell the more-than-enough. Who except a man of|77
the Tao can put his superabundant riches to the|77
service of the world?|77
Therefore, the Sage does his work without setting|77
any store by it, accomplishes his task without dwelling|77
upon it. He does not want his merits to be seen.|77
NOTHING in the world is softer and weaker than water;|78
But, for attacking the hard and strong, there is nothing like it!|78
For nothing can take its place.|78
That the weak overcomes the strong, and the soft overcomes the hard,|78
This is something known by all, but practised by none.|78
Therefore, the Sage says:|78
To receive the dirt of a country is to be the lord of its soil-shrines.|78
To bear the calamities of a country is to be the prince of the world.|78
Indeed, Truth sounds like its opposite!|78
WHEN a great wound is healed,|79
There will still remain a scar.|79
Can this be a desirable state of affairs?|79
Therefore, the Sage, holding the left-hand tally,|79
Performs his part of the covenant,|79
But lays no claims upon others.|79
The virtuous attends to his duties;|79
The virtueless knows only to levy duties upon the people. The Way of Heaven has no private affections,|79
But always accords with the good.|79
AH, for a small country with a small population!|80
Though there are highly efficient mechanical|80
contrivances, the people have no use for them. Let them|80
mind death and refrain from migrating to distant places.|80
Boats and carriages, weapons and armour there may still|80
be, but there are no occasions for using or displaying|80
them. Let the people revert to communication by|80
knotting cords. See to it that they are contented with|80
their food, pleased with their clothing, satisfied with|80
their houses, and inured to their simple ways of living.|80
Though there may be another country in the|80
neighbourhood so close that they are within sight of|80
each other and the crowing of cocks and barking of dogs|80
in one place can be heard in the other, yet there is no|80
traffic between them, and throughout their lives the two|80
peoples have nothing to do with each other.|80
SINCERE words are not sweet,|81
Sweet words are not sincere.|81
Good men are not argumentative,|81
The argumentative are not good.|81
The wise are not erudite,|81
The erudite are not wise.|81
The Sage does not take to hoarding.|81
The more he lives for others, the fuller is his life.|81
The more he gives, the more he abounds.|81
The Way of Heaven is to benefit, not to harm.|81
The Way of the Sage is to do his duty, not to strive with anyone.|81
