Text|Chapter
That which can be perceived is not the timeless That.|1
That which can be named is not the nameless One.|1
The source of heaven and earth is without form or substance.|1
Naming creates the ten thousand things.|1
When desire is absent, the mystery is obvious.|1
When desire occurs, creation unfolds.|1
Mystery and creation arise from the same source.|1
The source is emptiness.|1
Void within void.|1
The realm of Tao.|1
Judging beauty creates ugliness.|2
Defining good creates evil.|2
All and void arise together.|2
Hard and soft,|2
long and short,|2
high and low,|2
sound and silence,|2
now and then.|2
Opposites exist because of each other.|2
Therefore the sage acts by not-doing and teaches no-thought.|2
The ten thousand things arise and vanish without him.|2
He works without motive,|2
indifferent to outcome.|2
Because there is no doer,|2
his actions are timeless.|2
Bestowing honor breeds ambitions.|3
Hoarding treasure invites thieves.|3
Displaying objects of desire sows the seeds of discontent.|3
Therefore the sage governs|3
by emptying minds and filling bellies,|3
by weakening wills and strengthening bones.|3
He extols the virtue of desireless unknowing|3
and keeps intellects off balance.|3
When not-doing is accomplished,|3
nothing remains undone.|3
Tao is hollow emptiness.|4
The substance of All,|4
it is absent of substance.|4
Dimensionless Void,|4
it is the source of the ten thousand things.|4
It blunts sharpness,|4
unravels entanglements,|4
diffuses brightness,|4
merges with dust.|4
Dark, invisible, it only seems to be.|4
It is the child of no-thing|4
and the father of God.|4
The realm of heaven and earth is indifferent to the myriad creatures.|5
They appear as straw dogs.|5
The sage is indifferent to the multitudes of men.|5
They appear as straw dogs.|5
The realm of heaven and earth is like a bellows,|5
both empty and full.|5
Moving, it brings forth, endlessly.|5
More words, less understanding.|5
Hold fast to the core.|5
The urge of creation is ceaseless.|6
It is called the Dark Mother.|6
The womb of the Dark Mother|6
is the ground of heaven and earth.|6
Timeless, imperceptible,|6
it continues ever-present.|6
Endless use does not touch it.|6
The realm of heaven and earth is everlasting.|7
Why is it everlasting?|7
Because it is not conscious of itself.|7
Having no thought of being, it never is not.|7
Like this, the sage forgets himself|7
so is always present.|7
Without self-concern,|7
the self is eternal.|7
When self-interest subsides,|7
fulfillment happens.|7
Supreme virtue is like water.|8
It nourishes the ten thousand things without effort|8
and flows in places men shun.|8
It is like Tao.|8
Stand on solid ground.|8
Go deep into the heart.|8
Speak only what is true.|8
In friendship, be kind.|8
In governing, be just.|8
In enterprise, be able.|8
In action, watch the timing.|8
Do not contend with nature and nothing will go wrong.|8
An over-filled cup is difficult to carry.|9
An over-sharp point is easily broken.|9
Fill your house with gold and jade|9
and it cannot be protected.|9
Become puffed with pride|9
and disaster will follow.|9
Do only what needs doing then forget it.|9
This is the way of heaven.|9
While maintaining a body|10
can you become One?|10
While breathing the force of life|10
can you be innocent as a babe?|10
While polishing the dark mirror|10
can you be without dust?|10
While loving and ruling the people|10
can you refrain from action?|10
While coming and going from heaven|10
can you be passive as a woman?|10
Understanding all things|10
can you abide in unknowing?|10
Give birth and nurture.|10
Create without claim.|10
Lead without taking command.|10
This is supreme virtue.|10
Thirty spokes of the wheel converge|11
to define a hole.|11
Clay is molded into pots|11
to shape emptiness.|11
Walls are hammered into rooms|11
to enclosed space.|11
Windows are cut into walls|11
to frame absence.|11
Though things may have value,|11
without no-thing they are useless.|11
The five colors confuse the eye.|12
The five tones deaden the ear.|12
The five flavors dull the palette.|12
Racing and hunting madden the mind.|12
Valuable goods hinder movement.|12
Therefore the sage is guided by his gut, not his senses.|12
He attends to one and ignores the other.|12
Receive honor with dismay.|13
Accept misfortune gratefully.|13
Why receive honor with dismay?|13
Honor and dishonor cause the same disturbance.|13
With honor comes the fear of disgrace.|13
With disgrace comes anxiety and dread.|13
Why accept misfortune gratefully?|13
Misfortune weakens the bond to body and self.|13
Without a separate self, what misfortune is possible?|13
See misfortune as a condition of separation,|13
and you will become whole.|13
See the world as your body, and all will be delivered unto you.|13
Searching, we cannot see it.|14
We call it ephemeral.|14
Straining, we cannot hear it.|14
We call it ethereal.|14
Reaching, we cannot grasp it.|14
We call it intangible.|14
These three are often confused|14
because they are the same.|14
The One is not bright above and dark below.|14
Transparent, it moves in and out of nothing.|14
Its form has no shape.|14
Its image has no substance.|14
It is indistinct, elusive.|14
Nothing to face, nothing to follow.|14
Hold to the timeless Tao.|14
Abide in the present.|14
Now is the ancient beginning.|14
The old masters were deep, unfathomable,|15
profound beyond understanding.|15
Because they were unfathomable|15
we can only describe their demeanor.|15
Cautious, as if crossing an icy stream.|15
Alert, as if sensing danger.|15
Respectful, like visiting guests.|15
Yielding, like melting ice.|15
Simple, like uncarved wood.|15
Open, like beckoning valleys.|15
Mysterious, like opaque pools.|15
Still the mind and the mud settles.|15
Do nothing and action comes of itself.|15
One who embraces Tao has no desire for fulfillment.|15
Not desiring fulfillment, he is finished with birth and death.|15
Be completely empty.|16
Be completely still.|16
Witness the ten thousand things|16
appear and vanish in one motion.|16
Watch as they arise, linger,|16
and return to the source—stillness.|16
This is the way it is.|16
It is called everlasting life.|16
To witness the everlasting is to be awake.|16
Not seeing the everlasting, one engages in blind action.|16
Blind action leads to misfortune.|16
Seeing the everlasting, one encompasses all.|16
Encompassing all, one is impartial.|16
Being impartial, one acts nobly.|16
Acting nobly, one enters heaven.|16
Entering heaven is to be one with Tao.|16
Being one with Tao is to be everlasting.|16
Though the body dies, nothing is disturbed.|16
When a sage governs, people barely notice.|17
Lesser rulers are praised and loved.|17
Lesser still are feared and obeyed.|17
The least are ridiculed and despised.|17
Trust is earned by trusting.|17
The sage uses words sparingly.|17
His work is done without fanfare.|17
People say: “It happened by itself.”|17
When Tao is forgotten,|18
charity and righteousness are born.|18
When intelligence and knowledge are valued,|18
duplicity and pretense soon follow.|18
When the family is discordant,|18
love and duty are preached.|18
When the country is in chaos,|18
loyal patriots appear.|18
Abandon holiness, renounce wisdom.|19
It will be a hundred times better for everyone.|19
Eliminate morality and benevolence.|19
Love and empathy will naturally return.|19
Give up cleverness and profit.|19
Thieves and bandits will disappear.|19
But those are outward lessons, not the core.|19
Be simple.|19
Be true.|19
Cast off selfhood and desire.|19
Between yes and no, is there really much difference?|20
Good and bad, are they so far apart?|20
Must I think as others think?|20
Alas, there would be no end to fear.|20
The multitudes are busy with feasts and celebrations.|20
In spring they climb towers and enjoy the view.|20
I alone am unmoved, like an infant too young to smile.|20
Others have more than enough.|20
I alone have nothing.|20
My mind is that of a fool—empty.|20
Others are clear and bright.|20
I alone am nebulous and dim.|20
Others are alert and clever.|20
I alone am withdrawn,|20
adrift in the ocean,|20
directionless as swirling wind.|20
Everyone else has purpose.|20
I alone am stubborn and untamed.|20
I am different.|20
I am nourished by the Dark Mother.|20
Supreme virtue is to abide in Tao alone.|21
Tao is elusive and empty—|21
oh yes, utterly empty and elusive—|21
yet within it dreamlike images arise.|21
Oh yes, it is indistinct and nebulous,|21
but within it shadows take form.|21
Oh yes, it is mysterious and dark,|21
but within it appearances originate.|21
The origin of creation is the real.|21
Its manifestations are unceasing.|21
This can be witnessed.|21
How do I witness the origin of creation?|21
By looking!|21
Surrender and become whole.|22
Bend low and be straightened.|22
Become empty and be filled.|22
Burn out and be renewed.|22
Having nothing, beauty is revealed.|22
Having much, the way is hidden.|22
The sage abides in One|22
and thus is master of heaven and earth.|22
Not being self-absorbed, his vision is clear.|22
Not asserting himself, his light shines forth.|22
Not showing off, his merit is obvious.|22
Not praising himself, praise is showered upon him.|22
Not contending, nothing under heaven stands in his way.|22
This ancient saying, “Surrender and become whole,”|22
is it empty words?|22
Being whole means all things have returned to you.|22
To speak a short time is the way of nature.|23
High winds blow out before morning.|23
Hard rain subsides in a day.|23
What issues these?|23
The realm of heaven and earth.|23
If the realm of heaven and earth cannot maintain duration,|23
what chance has man?|23
This is why one embraces Tao.|23
He who aligns with Tao becomes one with Tao.|23
He who aligns with virtue attains supreme virtue.|23
He who fails to align with Tao is lost.|23
He who aligns with Tao is received by Tao.|23
He who aligns with virtue finds only virtue.|23
He who has become lost is close to home.|23
Faith comes to the faithful.|23
He who stands on tiptoe is unsteady.|24
He who strides too hard cannot go far.|24
He who shines a light on himself is not enlightened.|24
He who asserts himself is not distinguished.|24
He who praises himself has no merit.|24
He who brags of his success will not last long.|24
Observers of Tao see these as spoiled food and pointless action—|24
shunned even by the myriad creatures.|24
One who knows Tao does not abide them.|24
Formless no-thing.|25
Precedent of heaven and earth.|25
Timeless, unchanging, solitary, silent.|25
It is the mother of the ten thousand things.|25
I do not know its name.|25
I call it Tao.|25
If forced to describe it,|25
I call it great.|25
Great implies vast reaches.|25
Vast reaches implies far away.|25
Far away implies return.|25
Tao is great.|25
Heaven is great.|25
Earth is great.|25
Man, too, is great.|25
In the realm there are four greats,|25
and a noble man is one.|25
Man follows the way of earth.|25
Earth follows the way of heaven.|25
Heaven follows the way of Tao.|25
Tao is the great Way.|25
Gravity is the ground of lightness.|26
Stillness is the master of unrest.|26
The sage can travel all day,|26
yet never wander far from the baggage wagon.|26
Though splendor and spectacle may beckon,|26
he remains unmoved, indifferent.|26
Why should the lord of ten thousand chariots act lightly?|26
One who acts lightly is not grounded.|26
One who is restless is not his own master.|26
A good walker leaves no tracks.|27
A good speaker does not slip up.|27
A good accountant needs no counter.|27
A good doorsmith uses no bolts or locks|27
yet none can open what he closes.|27
A good binder uses no knots|27
yet what he binds cannot be unraveled.|27
The sage is good at saving souls and rejects no one.|27
He takes care of all things and abandons nothing.|27
This is called "the way of awareness."|27
The good man is the ignorant man's teacher.|27
The ignorant man is the good man's lesson.|27
To not honor the teacher and value the lesson—|27
no matter how much wisdom one acquires—|27
is to miss the mark.|27
This is an essential secret.|27
Know the strength of the male, but keep to the role of the female.|28
Be the river of the world.|28
Being the river of the world, supreme virtue flows without end.|28
Flowing without end, you are the timeless infant.|28
Know the purity of light but maintain darkness.|28
Be the model of the world.|28
Being the model of the world, supreme virtue is constant.|28
Maintaining constant virtue, you are the boundless realm.|28
Be worthy of high honors, but keep to the role of the lowly.|28
Be the valley of the world.|28
Being the valley of the world, supreme virtue is fulfilled.|28
Being fulfilled, you are the uncarved block.|28
The uncarved block appears as separate things.|28
The sage sees things as they are and rules the world.|28
Great power does not divide.|28
There are those who want to control the realm|29
and make it more to their liking.|29
They will never succeed.|29
The realm of heaven and earth is perfect, a sacred vessel.|29
It cannot be improved.|29
He who tries to change it, destroys it for himself.|29
He who tries to hold it, loses all contact.|29
It is natural for beings to sometimes lead, sometimes follow,|29
sometimes breathe hot, sometimes blow cold.|29
sometimes expand, sometimes decay,|29
sometimes overcome, sometimes collapse.|29
The sage therefore abandons pleasure, judgment and pride.|29
When counseling rulers, observers of Tao do not advise force.|30
This is certain to bring consequences.|30
Where great armies have passed, thorn bushes thrive.|30
Famine follows in the wake of war.|30
A good ruler does only what is necessary to achieve results.|30
He does not abuse position.|30
Achieve results, but do not glory in them.|30
Achieve results, but do not boast.|30
Achieve results, but be not proud.|30
Achieve results because there is no choice.|30
Achieve results but do not overpower.|30
Doing more than necessary brings exhaustion.|30
This is not in harmony with Tao.|30
What is not in harmony with Tao soon perishes.|30
Even the finest weapons are instruments of ill omen,|31
hated and feared by all creatures.|31
Observers of Tao have no use for them.|31
At home, a man of virtue gives precedence to the left.|31
At war, he gives precedence to the right.|31
Weapons are not the tools of a man of virtue.|31
Weapons are instruments of ill omen,|31
to be employed as a last resort.|31
Do not relish their use|31
or admire their excellence.|31
To see weapons as excellent is to relish killing.|31
If you relish killing you will never find the way.|31
On joyful occasions, precedence is given to the left.|31
On sad occasions, precedence is given to the right.|31
When an army is arrayed, the lieutenant is placed on the left.|31
The commander is placed on the right.|31
Thus, war is conducted as a funeral rite.|31
When multitudes are being killed,|31
hold in your heart only sorrow.|31
When victory is achieved,|31
mark it with mourning.|31
Tao is the uncarved block.|32
Timeless, undefined, infinitesimally subtle.|32
None is its master.|32
If lords and princes observed it,|32
the ten thousand things would arrive as guests to the table.|32
Heaven and earth would rejoice|32
and sweet nectar would fall,|32
though none under heaven had decreed it.|32
When the whole is divided the parts are named.|32
There are already too many names.|32
It is time to stop.|32
Knowing when to stop avoids exhaustion.|32
Tao in the world is like|32
stream flowing to river flowing to sea.|32
One who knows others is wise.|33
One who knows self is enlightened.|33
One who masters others is strong.|33
One who masters self is powerful.|33
Knowing you have enough is fulfillment.|33
Exerting strong effort brings exhaustion.|33
He who abides where he is lasts long.|33
He who dies without ceasing is timelessly present.|33
Great Tao flows everywhere,|34
left and right, all directions.|34
The ten thousand things depend on it|34
and it does not turn away.|34
Its purpose is fulfilled but it lays no claim.|34
It clothes and nourishes the ten thousand things|34
but is not their lord.|34
It desires nothing.|34
It is smaller than small.|34
The ten thousand things return to it|34
but it is not their master.|34
It is indeed great.|34
Because it knows nothing of greatness,|34
it is greater than great.|34
Extol the great illusion|35
and the men of the world will gather.|35
Talk of success, security and happiness|35
and the multitudes will flock.|35
Offer music and tasty food and travelers will stop in.|35
Talk of Tao has no flavor.|35
Look for it--there is nothing to see.|35
Listen for it--there is nothing to hear.|35
Merge with it--there is no boundary or end.|35
If you want it to contract, let it expand.|36
If you want it to weaken, let it gain strength.|36
To bring a thing down, let it be raised high.|36
To bring a thing to you, let go.|36
This is called "perceiving the subtle workings."|36
Soft and weak overcome hard and strong.|36
A fish should not leave deep water.|36
A country should not show off its power.|36
Tao does nothing yet nothing remains undone.|37
When a noble man observes this|37
the ten thousand things are transformed.|37
When the desire to act re-emerges,|37
it is stilled by the nameless no-thing.|37
Without things there is no desire.|37
Without desire there is stillness.|37
In stillness, the realm of heaven and earth is perfect.|37
The man of high virtue is not aware of himself|38
and thus attains supreme virtue.|38
The man of low virtue self-consciously strives|38
and thus is without virtue.|38
The wise man does nothing|38
yet leaves nothing undone.|38
The ignorant man is consumed by doing|38
yet little is accomplished.|38
The compassionate man acts without motive.|38
The righteous man acts to gain merit.|38
The moral man acts to impose order.|38
If no one responds,|38
he bares his arms and becomes an enforcer.|38
When Tao is lost there is virtue.|38
When virtue is lost there is goodness.|38
When goodness is lost there is morality.|38
When morality is lost, rules of conduct are imposed.|38
Rules are the remnants of trust and faith,|38
and the beginning of chaos.|38
Knowledge is an ornamental blossom of Tao|38
and the beginning of misunderstanding.|38
The sage dwells in the depths, not the surface,|38
in the root not the flower.|38
He abides in one and lets go of the other.|38
Before time, these ancestors arise from One:|39
Heaven arises from One and becomes clear.|39
Earth arises from One and becomes firm.|39
Spirit arises from One and becomes divine.|39
Emptiness arises from One and becomes creation.|39
The ten thousand things arise from One|39
and become manifest.|39
Kings and princes arise from One|39
and become exalted.|39
One is the source of All.|39
Separated from the Source:|39
the clearness of heaven would vanish,|39
the firmament of earth would dissolve,|39
the divinity of spirit would dissipate,|39
creation would become desolation.|39
The ten thousand things would perish,|39
and kingdoms would disappear.|39
Humility is the root of honor.|39
Lowliness is the foundation of esteem.|39
Thus, a noble man considers himself|39
orphaned, bereft, unworthy.|39
This is knowing the humble source—is it not?|39
To seek praise is not praiseworthy.|39
Do not jangle like jewelry.|39
Be still as stone.|39
Tao moves by returning and acts by yielding.|40
Thus, the ten thousand things arise into being.|40
Being arises from non-being.|40
Things arise from no-thing.|40
When the wise student hears of Tao|41
he practices diligently.|41
When the average student hears of Tao|41
he practices off and on.|41
When the foolish student hears of Tao|41
he laughs out loud.|41
If the foolish do not laugh, it is not Tao.|41
Thus it is said:|41
The path of light is through darkness.|41
The road ahead leads back.|41
The easy way is most difficult.|41
The highest fulfillment is emptiness.|41
True purity seems sullied.|41
True abundance seems bereft.|41
True power seems weak.|41
True substance seems hollow.|41
The greatest region has no boundaries.|41
The best tools are fashioned slowly.|41
The highest sounds are hard to hear.|41
The perfect form has no shape.|41
Tao is unseen, undefined.|41
Yet Tao alone nourishes|41
and brings all things to fulfillment.|41
From Tao, One arises.|42
From One, two.|42
From two, three.|42
Three becomes the ten thousand things.|42
The ten thousand things carry yin on their backs|42
and hold yang in their arms.|42
Existence depends on the two.|42
Men hate to be orphaned, bereft, unworthy,|42
yet this is how the noble man describes himself.|42
Loss is gain, gain is loss.|42
I teach what has always been taught:|42
"A fervent man is surprised by death."|42
I see this as the foundation of my teaching.|42
Under heaven, the soft and yielding|43
overcomes the hard and strong.|43
That without substance permeates the impenetrable.|43
Thus, I embrace non-action.|43
Teach without words.|43
Work without doing.|43
Few under heaven understand this.|43
Name or person, which is more dear?|44
Person or possessions, which is more precious?|44
Gain or loss, which is more harmful?|44
Excessive desire incurs great expense.|44
One who hoards treasure suffers loss.|44
One who knows enough is enough|44
will always have enough.|44
One who knows when to stop avoids exhaustion.|44
Thus, he will endure.|44
Perfection appears imperfect|45
but has no flaw.|45
Fulfillment appears as emptiness|45
but has no limit.|45
Great truth is a paradox.|45
Great wisdom is self-evident.|45
Great eloquence is unpracticed.|45
Movement overcomes cold.|45
Stillness overcomes heat.|45
Stillness and simplicity put all things right under heaven.|45
When Tao is embraced in the realm,|46
race horses haul their own manure.|46
When Tao is unknown in the realm,|46
war horses are bred at the borders.|46
There is no greater curse than desire,|46
no greater misfortune than greed.|46
He who knows enough is enough|46
will always have enough.|46
Without leaving home one can know the whole world.|47
Without looking outside one can see heaven.|47
Looking afar does not find what is near.|47
Thus, the sage knows without learning,|47
sees without seeking,|47
acts without doing.|47
For students of knowledge,|48
every day something is acquired.|48
For observers of Tao,|48
every day something falls away.|48
Less and less is done|48
until not-doing is achieved.|48
When there is no doer,|48
nothing remains to be done.|48
The realm of heaven and earth|48
is ruled by timeless principles.|48
He who tries to interfere is not ready to receive it.|48
The sage has no heart or mind of his own.|49
Thus, he knows the heart and mind of all.|49
I am good to the good|49
and good to the not-so-good.|49
This is the goodness of Virtue.|49
I trust the trustworthy|49
and have faith in those who should not be trusted.|49
This is the faith of Virtue.|49
The sage is in harmony|49
with the realm of heaven and earth.|49
His mind is merged with the world.|49
People turn to him and listen.|49
He treats them as his children.|49
In the passage from womb to grave|50
one in three are disciples of living.|50
One in three are disciples of death.|50
One in three are just passing through.|50
All believe they have life.|50
He who knows the truth of existence|50
does not fear wild bulls or tigers.|50
He wears no armor in battle.|50
Bulls have no place to thrust their horns.|50
Tigers have no place to sink their claws.|50
Weapons have no place to enter.|50
Why is this?|50
Because death is for the living.|50
Tao gives them life.|51
Virtue gives them nourishment.|51
The manifest world gives them form.|51
The tendencies of each make them what they are.|51
Therefore the ten thousand things honor Tao and esteem Virtue.|51
This honor and esteem are not commanded.|51
It is just the nature of things.|51
And so, all things arise from Tao.|51
By Virtue they are nourished, developed, clothed,|51
sheltered, soothed, aged and buried.|51
To create without possessing,|51
to act without making claims,|51
to lead without taking command—|51
this is timeless Virtue.|51
Where the realm of heaven and earth begins|52
could be called the mother of creation.|52
Knowing the mother, become the child.|52
Being the child, stay close to the mother.|52
Death will not bother you.|52
Stay quiet, keep inside,|52
and you will never want for anything.|52
Open your mouth, meddle in affairs,|52
and you are beyond rescue.|52
Perceiving the subtle is insight.|52
To yield requires strength.|52
Use the light of creation to become illuminated|52
and thus be saved.|52
This is called "entering the Absolute."|52
If I have the least bit of knowledge|53
I will follow the great Way alone|53
and fear nothing but being sidetracked.|53
The great Way is simple|53
but people delight in complexity.|53
The government is corrupt.|53
The fields are overgrown.|53
The granaries are empty.|53
Yet some wear fine clothes,|53
carry sharp swords,|53
gorge on food and drink,|53
and are surrounded by luxury.|53
They are thieves.|53
This is certainly not the great Way.|53
What is deeply rooted will not topple.|54
What is firmly grasped will not slip away.|54
It will be honored through generations of ancestors.|54
Cultivated in the self, Virtue is manifest.|54
Cultivated in the family, Virtue grows.|54
Cultivated in the village, Virtue flourishes.|54
Cultivated in the nation, Virtue abounds.|54
Cultivated in the universe, Virtue is everything.|54
As the self, observe the self.|54
As the family, observe the family.|54
As the village, observe the village.|54
As the nation, observe the nation.|54
As the universe, observe the universe.|54
How do I know the universe?|54
Like this.|54
A man of Virtue can be compared to a newborn child.|55
Snakes and scorpions do not strike him.|55
Fierce beasts do not prey upon him.|55
Birds of prey do not attack him.|55
Though his bones are soft and his muscles weak,|55
his grip is firm.|55
Without knowing the union of man and woman,|55
his organ stands erect.|55
His vital force is strong.|55
He can scream all day without becoming hoarse.|55
His harmony is perfect.|55
To know harmony is to know the everlasting.|55
To know the everlasting is enlightenment.|55
To interfere with life is ill-fated.|55
To control the breath causes strain.|55
If you exert yourself you will become exhausted.|55
This is not in harmony with Tao.|55
What is not in harmony with Tao does not long endure.|55
One who knows does not talk about it.|56
One who talks about it does not know.|56
Stay quiet.|56
Keep inside.|56
Blunt sharpness.|56
Unravel entanglements.|56
Diffuse brightness.|56
Merge with dust.|56
This is called "discovering original nature."|56
One who knows original nature is|56
indifferent to intimacy and estrangement,|56
unconcerned with benefit and harm,|56
immune to honor and disgrace.|56
He is embraced by heaven.|56
Rule the country with sincerity.|57
Wage war with cunning.|57
Master the universe with indifference.|57
How do I know this is the way it is?|57
Because of this:|57
The more taboos, the poorer the people's spirit.|57
The sharper men's weapons, the more trouble in the land.|57
The greater the ingenuity, the more clutter in the world.|57
The more abundant the laws, the more abundant the thieves.|57
Therefore the sage says:|57
I take no action and the people naturally reform.|57
I remain at peace and the people become content.|57
I do not meddle and the people become prosperous.|57
I desire nothing and the people return to original nature.|57
When government does not interfere, the people are genuine.|58
When government intrudes, the people are cunning.|58
Happiness is founded on misery.|58
Misery lurks within happiness.|58
Is there an end to it?|58
Nothing stays the same.|58
Honesty moves with deceit.|58
Good flows with evil.|58
But people's delusion persists.|58
Thus, the sage is sharp but not divisive,|58
straightforward but not hurtful,|58
principled but not severe,|58
illumined but not blinding.|58
In leading people and serving heaven,|59
nothing surpasses humility.|59
Humility is having no preferences.|59
Humility accumulates virtue.|59
Where virtue accumulates, nothing is impossible.|59
When nothing is impossible, there are no limits.|59
A man without limits is fit to rule the realm.|59
The mother of the realm is everlasting.|59
This is called being deeply rooted.|59
Timeless awareness of Tao.|59
Governing a country is like cooking a delicate fish.|60
Rule in observance of Tao|60
and the forces of adversity become harmless.|60
They do not lose their power,|60
only their power to harm.|60
The sage, too, does no harm|60
and so he is not harmed.|60
Virtue flows unimpeded.|60
A country becomes great by lying low,|61
like the delta of a great river.|61
The confluence of the realm.|61
The mother of the world.|61
The female conquers the male by stillness.|61
Being still, she takes the lower position.|61
A great country conquers a small country|61
by taking the lower position.|61
A small country conquers a great country|61
by merging with it.|61
Thus, the great country conquers by yielding,|61
the small country conquers by being absorbed.|61
The great country needs more people.|61
The small country needs greater purpose.|61
Each gets what it needs.|61
It is proper for greatness to yield.|61
Tao is the ground of the ten thousand things.|62
It is the refuge of the good man|62
and the guardian of the bad.|62
Fine speech can buy high rank.|62
Good deeds can earn respect.|62
Should one without them be abandoned?|62
Therefore, on the day the son is crowned|62
and the three ministers named,|62
do not send gifts of jade and teams of horses.|62
Remain still and offer Tao.|62
Why has Tao been honored since ancient times?|62
"Seek and you will find; transgress and you will be forgiven."|62
Is this not the reason?|62
Above all else, observe Tao.|62
Perform not-doing.|63
Work without motive.|63
Savor what has no flavor.|63
Regard the small as great, the few as many.|63
Repay injury with compassion.|63
See simplicity in the complex.|63
See greatness in small gestures.|63
Confront the difficult while easy.|63
Do great things in small increments.|63
The sage does nothing great,|63
but great things are accomplished.|63
Easy promises are easily broken.|63
Things taken lightly become difficult.|63
The sage regards nothing lightly,|63
therefore nothing is difficult.|63
That which is still is easy to contain.|64
What has not yet begun is easy to prevent.|64
The fragile is easily broken.|64
The minute is easily dispelled.|64
See things before they emerge.|64
Attend to them before they grow out of control.|64
A tree trunk that fills a man's arms|64
begins as a tiny shoot.|64
A terrace nine stories high|64
begins with a basket of dirt.|64
A journey of a thousand miles|64
begins underfoot.|64
Those who strive meet defeat.|64
Those who grasp lose their grip.|64
The sage does nothing and never fails.|64
He has nothing and never loses.|64
Failure often comes on the verge of success.|64
Be as careful in the end as the beginning|64
and there will be no failure.|64
The sage desires no-desire.|64
He does not value wealth.|64
He learns by not thinking.|64
He restores to others what has been lost.|64
He helps the ten thousand things return to original nature|64
but does not interfere.|64
The ancient observers of Tao did not teach it to others.|65
They let them remain simple and unknowing.|65
People are difficult to deal with when they think they know.|65
Leaders who think they know are a curse to those they lead.|65
Leaders with a simple heart are a blessing to all.|65
Both are manifestations of the same truth.|65
Knowing the truth is Virtue.|65
Virtue is mysterious, profound, far reaching.|65
Reaching far, it returns to itself and is complete.|65
Rivers rule valleys and seas rule rivers|66
because they take the lower position.|66
The sage is elevated by placing himself below others.|66
He leads by leaving himself behind.|66
When he assumes high position, the people do not feel his weight.|66
When he rules they do not feel threatened.|66
The realm rejoices and never tires of his presence.|66
Because he does not contend, nothing stands against him.|66
Everyone agrees the Tao I teach is great, yet unlike anything else.|67
Indeed, if it were not singular it would not endure.|67
I hold three treasures close:|67
The first is unconditional regard for all.|67
The second is being content with little.|67
The third is not placing myself before others.|67
From compassion comes courage.|67
From contentment comes an open heart.|67
From humility comes the capacity to lead.|67
Daring without mercy,|67
giving without generosity,|67
ruling without modesty,|67
this is the way of death.|67
Attacking with compassion, you are victorious.|67
Defending with compassion, you are impregnable.|67
What heaven favors it infuses with compassion.|67
A good general is not aggressive.|68
A good warrior is not wrathful.|68
A skillful conqueror does not instigate battle.|68
A skillful employer serves those under him.|68
This is the virtue of not contending.|68
This is mastering the strength of others.|68
This is being in accord with the principles of heaven.|68
Skillful warriors have a saying:|69
"Do not move first, play the guest.|69
Do not move forward an inch, retreat a foot."|69
This is called advancing without moving.|69
Reaching without showing one's arms.|69
Capturing without attacking.|69
Doing battle without weapons.|69
There is no greater mistake than underestimating the enemy.|69
Underestimating the enemy, I risk losing everything of value.|69
Thus, when equal opponents are matched,|69
the one aware of sorrow will prevail.|69
What I teach is easy to understand and practice,|70
yet no one understands it or puts it to practice.|70
My words are from the source.|70
My actions are those of the ancestor.|70
People do not understand this.|70
Therefore, they do not understand me.|70
Those who see me as I am are rare.|70
Those who seek to follow my teachings are few.|70
The sage wears coarse clothing|70
but carries jade in his pockets.|70
To know that you do not know is clarity.|71
To think that you know is sickness.|71
Being sick of sickness, one attains clarity.|71
The sage is sick of sickness.|71
Therefore, he is clear.|71
When people do not respect power,|72
disaster is on the horizon.|72
Do not limit their space.|72
Do not disrupt their lives.|72
Do not oppress them|72
and they will not tire of you.|72
The sage knows himself, but does not claim knowledge.|72
He loves himself, but does not feel important.|72
He lets go of that and chooses this.|72
A courageous and reckless man will kill or be killed.|73
A courageous and careful man preserves life.|73
Of the two, which is beneficial and which brings harm?|73
Who knows what heaven favors.|73
Even the sage is unsure.|73
The way of heaven does not contend, yet overcomes.|73
Does not speak, yet converses.|73
Without being summoned it comes of its own,|73
unhurried, and according to plan.|73
The net of heaven is vast.|73
Though the mesh is wide, nothing slips through.|73
If people are not afraid of death,|74
why threaten them with death?|74
If people are in constant fear of death,|74
and if being unruly means you will be killed,|74
who would dare be unruly?|74
Who would dare kill him?|74
There is always a lord of death.|74
Trying to do his job is like|74
taking the place of an artisan.|74
He who tries to carve like a master carpenter|74
rarely avoids being cut.|74
Why are the people starving?|75
The government takes their grain for taxes.|75
Therefore they are starving.|75
Why are the people rebellious?|75
The government interferes in their lives.|75
Therefore they are rebellious.|75
Why do people ignore the gravity of death?|75
They are consumed by the intensity of life.|75
Therefore they ignore the gravity of death.|75
One who is not consumed by life|75
is better off than one who values it.|75
A man is born supple and soft.|76
At death he is rigid and hard.|76
The ten thousand things, the grass, the trees,|76
while living are tender and pliant.|76
In death they are dry and withered.|76
The hard and unbending are companions of death.|76
The soft and yielding are companions of life.|76
Thus, an inflexible army is easily defeated.|76
An unbending tree is easily broken.|76
The hard and strong are laid low.|76
The soft and yielding are raised up.|76
The way of heaven, is it not like the stringing of a bow?|77
The high end is lowered, the low is raised up.|77
If the string is too long it is shortened.|77
If the string is too short it is lengthened.|77
The way of heaven takes from the excessive|77
and gives to the insufficient.|77
The way of man is different.|77
Those with too much take from those who have little.|77
Who keeps just enough and gives the rest to the world?|77
Only observers of Tao.|77
The sage works without expectation.|77
Achieves without taking credit.|77
He does not desire to seem worthy.|77
In all the world nothing is softer and weaker than water.|78
Yet for overcoming the hard and strong it is unequaled.|78
The pliant overcomes the unbending.|78
The submissive overcomes the unyielding.|78
Everyone knows this but no one puts it into practice.|78
Therefore the sage says:|78
He who takes on the suffering of the world is fit to rule it.|78
One who accepts the evils of the world as his own|78
is a king under heaven.|78
Truth is often a paradox.|78
When bitter quarrels are settled,|79
enmity is sure to remain.|79
What can be done?|79
A man of virtue pays his debts|79
but does not exact his due.|79
He fulfills his obligations|79
but makes no demands.|79
The Tao of heaven plays no favorites.|79
It flows with Virtue.|79
Let the state be small.|80
Let the people be few.|80
Though they have equipment to arm ten battalions|80
they do not do it.|80
They take death seriously and do not venture far.|80
They have ships and carts|80
but there is no place they want to go.|80
They have armor and weapons|80
but they are not displayed.|80
Men return to knotting rope.|80
They enjoy their meals and are comfortable in their clothes.|80
They are content in their homes and happy with their lives.|80
Though the neighboring state is so close|80
you can hear the cocks and dogs,|80
they leave each other in peace as they grow old and die.|80
Truth is not eloquent.|81
Eloquence is not truth.|81
Wise men do not try to persuade.|81
Whoever tries to persuade is not wise.|81
One who knows, claims unknowing.|81
One who claims knowledge, does not know.|81
The sage does not acquire.|81
He bestows what he has on others|81
and always has more.|81
The more he gives, the greater his abundance.|81
The way of heaven is to give without harm.|81
The way of the sage is to serve without striving.|81
