The Tao the can be told of|1|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Is not the Absolute Tao;|1|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
The Names that can be given|1|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Are not Absolute Names.|1|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
The Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth;|1|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
The Named is the Mother of All Things.|1|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Therefore:|1|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Oftentimes, one strips oneself of passion|1|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
In order to see the Secret of Life;|1|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Oftentimes, one regards life with passion,|1|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
In order to see its manifest forms.|1|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
These two (the Secret and its manifestations)|1|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Are (in their nature) the same;|1|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
They are given different names|1|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
When they become manifest.|1|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
They may both be called the Cosmic Mystery:|1|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Reaching from the Mystery into the Deeper Mystery|1|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Is the Gate to the Secret of All Life.|1|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
When the people of the Earth all know beauty as beauty,|2|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
There arises (the recognition of) ugliness.|2|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
When the people of the Earth all know the good as good,|2|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
There arises (the recognition of) evil.|2|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore:|2|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Being and non-being interdepend in growth;|2|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Difficult and easy interdepend in completion;|2|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Long and short interdepend in contrast;|2|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
High and low interdepend in position;|2|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Tones and voice interdepend in harmony;|2|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Front and behind interdepend in company.|2|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Therefore the Sage:|2|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Manages affairs without action;|2|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Preaches the doctrine without words;|2|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
All things take their rise, but he does not turn away from them;|2|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He gives them life, but does not take possession of them;|2|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He acts, but does not appropriate;|2|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Accomplishes, but claims no credit.|2|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
It is because he lays claim to no credit|2|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
That the credit cannot be taken away from him.|2|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Exalt not the wise,|3|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
So that the people shall not scheme and contend;|3|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Prize not rare objects,|3|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
So that the people shall not steal;|3|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Shut out from site the things of desire,|3|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
So that the people's hearts shall not be disturbed.|3|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore in the government of the Sage:|3|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He keeps empty their hearts|3|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Makes full their bellies,|3|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Discourages their ambitions,|3|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Strengthens their frames;|3|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
So that the people may be innocent of knowledge and desires.|3|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And the cunning ones shall not presume to interfere.|3|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
By action without deeds|3|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
May all live in peace.|3|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Tao is a hollow vessel,|4|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
And its use is inexhaustible!|4|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Fathomless!|4|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Like the fountain head of all things,|4|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Its sharp edges rounded off,|4|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Its tangles untied,|4|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Its light tempered,|4|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Its turmoil submerged,|4|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Yet dark like deep water it seems to remain.|4|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
I do not know whose Son it it,|4|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
An image of what existed before God.|4|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Nature is unkind:|5|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
It treats the creation like sacrificial straw-dogs.|5|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The Sage is unkind:|5|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He treats the people like sacrificial straw-dogs.|5|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
How the universe is like a bellows!|5|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Empty, yet it gives a supply that never fails;|5|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The more it is worked, the more it brings forth.|5|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
By many words is wit exhausted.|5|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Rather, therefore, hold to the core.|5|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The Spirit of the Valley never dies.|6|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
It is called the Mystic Female.|6|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The Door of the Mystic Female|6|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Is the root of Heaven and Earth.|6|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Continuously, continuously,|6|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
It seems to remain.|6|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Draw upon it|6|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And it serves you with ease.|6|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The universe is everlasting.|7|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The reason the universe is everlasting|7|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Is that it does not life for Self.|7|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Therefore it can long endure.|7|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore the Sage puts himself last,|7|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
And finds himself in the foremost place;|7|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Regards his body as accidental,|7|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
And his body is thereby preserved.|7|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Is it not because he does not live for Self|7|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
That his Self is realized?|7|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
The best of men is like water;|8|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Water benefits all things|8|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And does not compete with them.|8|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
It dwells in (the lowly) places that all disdain -|8|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Wherein it comes near to the Tao.|8|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
In his dwelling, (the Sage) loves the (lowly) earth;|8|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
In his heart, he loves what is profound;|8|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
In his relations with others, he loves kindness;|8|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
In his words, he loves sincerity;|8|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
In government, he loves peace;|8|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
In business affairs, he loves ability;|8|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
In hi actions, he loves choosing the right time.|8|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
It is because he does not contend|8|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
That he is without reproach.|8|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Stretch (a bow) to the very full,|9|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
And you will wish you had stopped in time.|9|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Temper a (sword-edge) to its very sharpest,|9|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
And the edge will not last long.|9|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
When gold and jade fill your hall,|9|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
You will not be able to keep them safe.|9|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To be proud with wealth and honor|9|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Is to sow seeds of one's own downfall.|9|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Retire when your work is done,|9|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Such is Heaven's way.|9|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
In embracing the One with your soul,|10|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Can you never forsake the Tao?|10|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
In controlling your vital force to achieve gentleness,|10|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Can you become like the new-born child?|10|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
In cleansing and purifying your Mystic vision,|10|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Can you strive after perfection?|10|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
In loving the people and governing the kingdom,|10|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Can you rule without interference?|10|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
In opening and shutting the Gate of Heaven,|10|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Can you play the part of the Female?|10|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
In comprehending all knowledge,|10|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Can you renounce the mind?|10|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Thirty spokes unite around the nave;|11|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
From their not-being (loss of their individuality)|11|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Arises the utility of the wheel.|11|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Mold clay into a vessel;|11|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
From its not-being (in the vessel's hollow)|11|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Arises the utility of the vessel.|11|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Cut out doors and windows in the house (-wall),|11|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
From their not-being (empty space) arises the utility of the house.|11|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore by the existence of things we profit.|11|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And by the non-existence of things we are served.|11|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The five colors blind the eyes of man;|12|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The five musical notes deafen the ears of man;|12|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
The five flavors dull the taste of man;|12|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Horse-racing, hunting and chasing madden the minds of man;|12|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Rare, valuable goods keep their owners awake at night.|12|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Therefore the Sage:|12|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Provides for the belly and not the eye.|12|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Hence, he rejects the one and accepts the other.|12|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
"Favor and disgrace cause one dismay;|13
What we value and what we fear are within our Self."|13|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
What does this mean:|13|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Favor and disgrace cause one dismay?|13|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Those who receive a favor from above|13|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Are dismayed when they receive it,|13|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And dismayed when they lose it.|13|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
What does this mean:|13|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
What we value and what we fear are within our Self?|13|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
We have fears because we have a self.|13|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
When we do not regard that self as self,|13|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
What have we to fear?|13|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore he who values the world as his self|13|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
May then be entrusted with the government of the world;|13|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And he who loves the world as his self -|13|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The world may then be entrusted to his care.|13|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Looked at, but cannot be seen -|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
That is called the Invisible (yi).|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Listened to, but cannot be heard -|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
That is called the Inaudible (hsi).|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Grasped at, but cannot be touched -|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
That is called the Intangible (wei).|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
These three elude our inquiries|14|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And hence blend and become One.|14|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Not by its rising, is there light,|14|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Nor by its sinking, is there darkness.|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Unceasing, continuous,|14|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
It cannot be defined,|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And reverts again to the realm of nothingness.|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
That is why it is called the Form of the Formless,|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
The Image of Nothingness.|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
That is why it is called the Elusive:|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Meet it and you do not see its face;|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0

The wise ones of old had subtle wisdom and depth of understanding,|15|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
So profound that they could not be understood.|15|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And because they could not be understood,|15|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Perforce must they be so described:|15|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Cautious, like crossing a wintry stream,|15|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Irresolute, like one fearing danger all around,|15|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Grave, like one acting as guest,|15|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Self-effacing, like ice beginning to melt,|15|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Genuine, like a piece of undressed wood,|15|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Open-minded, like a valley,|15|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And mixing freely, like murky water.|15|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Who can find repose in a muddy world?|15|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
By lying still, it becomes clear.|15|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Who can maintain his calm for long?|15|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
By activity, it comes back to life.|15|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
He who embraces this Tao|15|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Guards against being over-full.|15|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Because he guards against being over-full,|15|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
He is beyond wearing out and renewal.|15|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Attain the utmost in Passivity,|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0

The myriad things take shape and rise to activity,|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0

To return to the root is Repose;|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
It is called going back to one's Destiny.|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Going back to one's Destiny is to find the Eternal Law.|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To know the Eternal Law is Enlightenment.|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And not to know the Eternal Law|16|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Is to court disaster.|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He who knows the Eternal Law is tolerant;|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Being tolerant, he is impartial;|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Being impartial, he is kingly;|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Being kingly, he is in accord with Nature;|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Being in accord with Nature, he is in accord with Tao;|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Being in accord with Tao, he is eternal,|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0

When they do not command the people's faith,|17|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0

Its Named (manifested forms) have never ceased,|21|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
By which we may view the Father of All Things.|21|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
How do I know the shape of the Father of All Things?|21|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Through these (manifested forms)!|21|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To yield is to be preserved whole.|22|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To be bent is to become straight.|22|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
To be hollow is to be filled.|22|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
To be tattered is to be renewed.|22|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To be in want is to possess.|22|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
To have plenty is to be confused.|22|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Therefore the Sage embraces the One,|22|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And becomes the model of the world.|22|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He does not reveal himself,|22|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
And is therefore luminous.|22|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He does not justify himself,|22|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And is therefore far-famed.|22|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He does not boast of himself,|22|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And therefore people give him credit.|22|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He does not pride himself,|22|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And is therefore the chief among men.|22|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Is it not indeed true, as the ancients say,|22|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
To yield is to be preserved whole?|22|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Thus he is preserved and the world does him homage.|22|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Nature says few words:|23|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Hence it is that a squall lasts not a whole morning.|23|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
A rainstorm continues not a whole day.|23|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Where do they come from?|23|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
From Nature.|23|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Even Nature does not last long (in its utterances),|23|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
How much less should human beings?|23|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore it is that:|23|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He who follows the Tao is identified with the Tao.|23|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He who follows Character (Teh) is identified with Character.|23|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
He who abandons (Tao) is identified with abandonment (of Tao).|23|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He who is identified with Tao -|23|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Tao is also glad to welcome him.|23|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He who is identified with character -|23|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Character is also glad to welcome him.|23|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He who is identified with abandonment -|23|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Abandonment is also glad t welcome him.|23|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He who has not enough faith|23|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Will not be able to command faith from others.|23|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He who stands on tiptoe does not stand (firm);|24|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He who strains his strides does not walk (well);|24|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He who reveals himself is not luminous;|24|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
He who justifies himself is not far-famed;|24|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He who boasts of himself is not given credit;|24|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He who prides himself is not chief among men.|24|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
These in the eyes of Tao|24|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
"Are called ""the dregs and tumors of Virtue,"""|24|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Which are things of disgust.|24|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Therefore the man of Tao spurns them.|24|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Before the Heaven and Earth existed|25|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
There was something nebulous:|25|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Silent, isolated,|25|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Standing alone, changing not,|25|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Eternally revolving without fail,|25|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Worthy to be the Mother of All Things.|25|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
I do not know its name|25|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
And address it as Tao.|25|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
"If forced to give it a name, I shall call it ""Great."""|25|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Being great implies reaching out in space,|25|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Reaching out in space implies far-reaching,|25|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Far-reaching implies reversion to the original point.|25|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Therefore:|25|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Tao is Great,|25|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The Heaven is great,|25|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The Earth is great,|25|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The King is also great.|25|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
There are the Great Four in the universe,|25|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
And the King is one of them.|25|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Man models himself after the Earth;|25|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
The Earth models itself after Heaven;|25|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
The Heaven models itself after Tao;|25|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Tao models itself after nature.|25|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
The Solid is the root of the light;|26|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The Quiescent is the master of the Hasty.|26|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Therefore the Sage travels all day|26|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Yet never leaves his provision-cart.|26|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
In the midst of honor and glory,|26|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He lives leisurely, undisturbed.|26|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
How can the ruler of a great country|26|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Make light of his body in the empire (by rushing about)?|26|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
In light frivolity, the Center is lost;|26|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
In hasty action, self-mastery is lost.|26|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
A good runner leaves no track.|27|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
A good speech leaves no flaws for attack.|27|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
A good reckoner makes use of no counters.|27|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
A well-shut door makes use of no bolts,|27|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
And yet cannot be opened.|27|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
A well-tied knot makes use of no rope,|27|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
And yet cannot be untied.|27|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore the Sage is good at helping men;|27|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
For that reason there is no rejected (useless) person.|27|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
He is good at saving things;|27|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
For that reason there is nothing rejected.|27|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
- This is called stealing the Light.|27|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Therefore the good man is the Teacher of the bad.|27|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And the bad man is the lesson of the good.|27|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He who neither values his teacher|27|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Nor loves the lesson|27|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Is one gone far astray,|27|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Though he be learned.|27|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
- Such is the subtle secret.|27|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
He who is aware of the Male|28|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
But keeps to the Female|28|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Becomes the ravine of the world.|28|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Being the ravine of the world,|28|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
He has the original character (teh) which is not cut up.|28|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
And returns again to the (innocence of the) babe.|28|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
He who is conscious of the white (bright)|28|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
But keeps to the black (dark)|28|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Becomes the model for the world.|28|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Being the model for the world,|28|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He has the eternal power which never errs,|28|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And returns again to the Primordial Nothingness.|28|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He who is familiar with honor and glory|28|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
But keeps to obscurity|28|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Becomes the valley of the world.|28|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Being the valley of the world,|28|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
He has an eternal power which always suffices,|28|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And returns again to the natural integrity of uncarved wood.|28|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Break up this uncarved wood|28|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And it is shaped into vessel|28|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
In the hands of the Sage|28|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
They become the officials and magistrates.|28|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore the great ruler does not cut up.|28|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
There are those who will conquer the world|29|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And make of it (what they conceive or desire).|29|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
I see that they will not succeed.|29|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
(For) the world is God's own Vessel|29|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
It cannot be made (by human interference).|29|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He who makes it spoils it.|29|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
He who holds it loses it.|29|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
For:  Some things go forward,|29|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Some things follow behind;|29|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
some blow hot,|29|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
And some blow cold;|29|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Some are strong,|29|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
And some are weak;|29|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Some may break,|29|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0

(But when) the man of superior li acts and finds no response,|38|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
He rolls up his sleeves to force it on others.|38|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Therefore:|38|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
After Tao is lost, then (arises the doctrine of) humanity.|38|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
After humanity is lost, then (arises the doctrine of) justice.|38|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
After justice is lost, then (arises the doctrine of) li.|38|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Now li is the thinning out of loyalty and honesty of heart.|38|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0

Therefore the noble man dwells in the heavy (base),|38|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
And not in the thinning (end).|38|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He dwells in the fruit,|38|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0

Through possession of the One, the valleys were made full,|39|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Through possession of the One, all things lived and grew,|39|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Through possession of the One, the princes and dukes|39|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
became the ennobled of the people.|39|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
- that was how each became so.|39|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Without clarity, the Heavens would shake,|39|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Without stability, the Earth would quake,|39|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Without spiritual power, the gods would crumble,|39|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Without being filled, the valleys would crack,|39|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Without the life-giving power, all things would perish,|39|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Without the ennobling power, the princes and dukes would stumble.|39|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
therefore the nobility depend upon the common man for support,|39|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
And the exalted ones depend upon the lowly for their base.|39|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
That is why the princes and dukes call themselves|39|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
"the orphaned, ""the lonely one,"" ""the unworthy."""|39|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Is is not true then that they depend upon the common man for support?|39|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Truly, take down the parts of a chariot,|39|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
And there is no chariot (left).|39|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Rather than jingle like the jade,|39|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Rumble like the rocks.|39|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Reversion is the action of Tao.|40|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Gentleness is the function of Tao.|40|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The things of this world come from Being,|40|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And Being (comes) from Non-being.|40|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
When the highest type of men hear the Tao (truth),|41|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
they try hard to live in accordance with it.|41|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
When the mediocre type hear the Tao,|41|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
they seem to be aware and yet unaware of it.|41|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
When the lowest type hear the Tao,|41|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
They break into loud laughter -|41|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
If it were not laughed at, it would not be Tao.|41|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Therefore there is the established saying:|41|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
"Who understands Tao seems dull of comprehension;|41
Who is advance in Tao seems to slip backwards;|41
Who moves on the even Tao (Path) seems to go up and down."|41|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Superior character appears like a hollow (valley);|41|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Sheer white appears like tarnished;|41|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Great character appears like infirm;|41|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Pure worth appears like contaminated.|41|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Great space has no corners;|41|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Great talent takes long to mature;|41|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Great music is faintly heard;|41|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Great form has no contour;|41|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
And Tao is hidden without a name.|41|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
It is this Tao that is adept at lending (its power)|41|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
and bringing fulfillment.|41|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Out of Tao, One is born;|42|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Out of One, Two;|42|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Out of Two, Three;|42|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Out of Three, the created universe.|42|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
The created universe carries the yin at its back|42|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
and the yang in front;|42|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Through the union of the pervading principles it|42|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
reaches harmony.|42|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
"To be ""orphaned,"" ""lonely"" and ""unworthy"" is what men hate most."|42|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Yet the princes and dukes call themselves by such names.|42|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
For sometimes things are benefited by being taken away from,|42|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
And suffer by being added to.|42|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Others have taught this maxim,|42|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Which I shall teach also:|42|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The violent man shall die a violent death.|42|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
This I shall regard as my spiritual teacher.|42|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The softest substance of the world|43|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Goes through the hardest.|43|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0

Through this I know the benefit of taking no action.|43|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The teaching without words|43|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And the benefit of taking no action|43|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Are without compare in the universe.|43|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Fame or one's own self, which does one love more?|44|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
One's own self or material goods, which has more worth?|44|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Loss (of self) or possession (of goods), which is the greater evil?|44|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Therefore: he who loves most spends most,|44|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
He who hoards much loses much.|44|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The contented man meets no disgrace;|44|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Who know when to stop runs into no danger -|44|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He can long endure.|44|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The highest perfection is like imperfection,|45|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And its use is never impaired.|45|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The greatest abundance seems meager,|45|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
And its use will never fail.|45|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
What s most straight appears devious,|45|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The greatest skill appears clumsiness;|45|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
The greatest eloquence seems like stuttering.|45|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Movement overcomes cold,|45|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
(But) keeping still overcomes heat.|45|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Who is calm and quiet becomes the guide for the universe.|45|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
When the world lives in accord with Tao,|46|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Racing horses are turned back to haul refuse carts.|46|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
When the world lives not in accord with Tao,|46|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Cavalry abounds in the countryside.|46|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0
There is no greater curse than the lack of contentment.|46|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
No greater sin than the desire for possession.|46|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Therefore he who is contented with contentment|46|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
shall be always content.|46|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Without stepping outside one's doors,|47|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
One can know what is happening in the world,|47|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Without looking out of one's windows,|47|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
One can see the Tao of heaven.|47|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The farther one pursues knowledge,|47|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The less one knows.|47|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore the Sage knows without running about,|47|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Understands without seeing,|47|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Accomplishes without doing.|47|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The student of knowledge (aims at) learning day by day;|48|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The student of Tao (aims at) losing day by day.|48|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
By continual losing|48|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
One reaches doing nothing (laissez-faire).|48|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
He who conquers the world often does so by doing nothing.|48|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
When one is compelled to do something,|48|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
The world is already beyond his conquering.|48|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The Sage has no decided opinions and feelings,|49|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
But regards the people's opinions and feelings as his own.|49|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The good ones I declare good;|49|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The bad ones I also declare good.|49|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
That is the goodness of Virtue.|49|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The honest ones I believe;|49|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The liars I also believe;|49|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
That is the faith of Virtue.|49|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The Sage dwells in the world peacefully, harmoniously.|49|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The people of the world are brought into a community of heart,|49|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And the Sage regards them all as his own children.|49|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Out of life, death enters.|50|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The companions (organs) of life are thirteen;|50|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The companions (organs) of death are (also) thirteen.|50|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
What send man to death in this life are also (these) thirteen.|50|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
How is it so?|50|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Because of the intense activity of multiplying life.|50|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
It has been said that the who is a good preserver of hi life|50|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Meets no tigers or wild buffaloes on land,|50|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Is not vulnerable to weapons in the field of battle.|50|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
The horns of the wild buffalo are powerless against him.|50|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
How is it so?|50|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Because he is beyond death.|50|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Tao gives them birth,|51|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Teh (character) fosters them.|51|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The material world gives them form.|51|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The circumstances of the moment complete them.|51|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore all things of the universe worship Tao and exalt Teh.|51|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Tao is worshipped and Teh is exalted|51|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Without anyone's order but is so of its own accord.|51|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore Tao gives them birth,|51|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Teh fosters them,|51|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Makes them grow, develops them,|51|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Gives them a harbor, a place to dwell in peace,|51|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Feeds them and shelter them.|51|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
It gives them birth and does not own them,|51|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Acts (helps) and does not appropriate them,|51|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Is superior, and does not control them.|51|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
- This is the Mystic Virtue.|51|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
There was a beginning of the universe|52|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Which may be regarded as the Mother of the Universe.|52|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
From the Mother, we may know her sons.|52|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
After knowing the sons, keep to the Mother.|52|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Thus one's whole life may be preserved from harm.|52|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Stop its apertures,|52|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Close its doors,|52|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And one's whole life is without toil.|52|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Open its apertures,|52|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Be busy about its affairs,|52|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And one's whole life is beyond redemption.|52|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He who can see the small is clear-sighted;|52|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
He who stays by gentility is strong.|52|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
use the light,|52|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
And return to clear-sightedness -|52|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Thus cause not yourself later distress.|52|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
- This is to rest in the Absolute.|52|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
If I were possessed of Austere Knowledge,|53|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Walking on the Main Path (Tao),|53|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
I would avoid the by-paths.|53|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
the Main path is easy to walk on,|53|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Yet people love the small by-paths.|53|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The (official) courts are spic and span,|53|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
(While) the fields go untilled,|53|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
And the (people's) granaries are very low.|53|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
(Yet) clad in embroidered gowns,|53|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
And carrying find swords,|53|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Surfeited with good food and drinks,|53|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
(They are) splitting with wealth and possessions.|53|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
- This is to lead the world toward brigandage.|53|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Is this not corruption of Tao?|53|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Who is firmly established is not easily shaken.|54|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Who has a firm grasp does not easily let go.|54|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
From generation to generation his ancestral sacrifices|54|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Shall be continued without fail.|54|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Cultivated in the individual, character will become genuine;|54|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Cultivated in the family, character will become abundant;|54|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Cultivated in the village, character will multiply;|54|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Cultivated in the state, character will prosper;|54|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Cultivated in the world, character will become universal.|54|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore:|54|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0

According to (the character of ) the world,|54|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
judge the world.|54|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
How do I know this is so?|54|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
By this.|54|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Who is rich in character|55|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Is like a child.|55|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
No poisonous insects sting him,|55|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
No wild beasts attack him,|55|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And no birds of prey pounce upon him.|55|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
His bones are soft, his sinews tender, yet his grip is strong.|55|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Not knowing the union of male and female, yet his organs are complete,|55|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Which means his vigor is unspoiled.|55|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Crying the whole day, yet his voice never runs hoarse,|55|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Which means his (natural) harmony is perfect.|55|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To know harmony is to be in accord with the eternal,|55|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
(And) to know eternity is called discerning.|55|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
(But) to improve upon life is called an ill-omen;|55|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To let go the emotions through impulse is called assertiveness.|55|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
(For) things age after reaching their prime;|55|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
That (assertiveness) would be against Tao.|55|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
And he who is against Tao perishes young.|55|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He who knows does not speak;|56|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He who speaks does not know.|56|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Fill up its apertures,|56|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Close its doors,|56|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Dull its edges,|56|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Untie its tangles,|56|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Soften its light,|56|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Submerge its turmoil,|56|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
- This is the Mystic Unity.|56|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Then love and hatred cannot touch him.|56|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Profit and loss cannot reach him.|56|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Honor and disgrace cannot affect him.|56|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore is he always the honored one of the world.|56|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Rule a kingdom by the Normal.|57|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Fight a battle by (abnormal) tactics of surprise.|57|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Win the world by doing nothing.|57|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
How do I know it is so?|57|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Through this: -|57|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The more prohibitions there are,|57|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The poorer the people become.|57|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The more sharp weapons there are,|57|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The greater the chaos in the state.|57|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The more skills of technique,|57|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The more cunning things are produced.|57|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The greater the number of statutes,|57|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
The greater the number of thieves and brigands.|57|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore the sage says:|57|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
I do nothing and the people are reformed of themselves.|57|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
I love quietude and the people are righteous of themselves.|57|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
I deal in no business and the people grow rich by themselves.|57|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
I have no desires and the people are simple|57|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
and honest by themselves.|57|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
When the government is lazy and dull,|58|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Its people are unspoiled;|58|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
When the government is efficient and smart,|58|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Its people are discontented.|58|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Disaster is the avenue of fortune,|58|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
(And) fortune is the concealment for disaster.|58|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Who would be able to know its ultimate results?|58|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
(As it is), there would never be the normal.|58|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
But the normal would (immediately) revert to the deceitful.|58|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
And the good revert to the sinister.|58|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Thus long has mankind gone astray!|58|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore the Sage is square (has firm principles),|58|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
but not cutting (sharp-cornered),|58|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Has integrity but does not hurt (others),|58|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Is straight, but not high-handed,|58|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Bright, but not dazzling.|58|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
In managing human affairs, there is no better rule|59|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
than to be sparing.|59|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
To be sparing is to forestall;|59|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
To forestall is to be prepared and strengthened;|59|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To be prepared and strengthened is to be ever-victorious;|59|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To be ever-victorious is to have infinite capacity;|59|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He who has infinite capacity is fit to rule a country,|59|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And the Mother (principle) of a ruling country can long endure.|59|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
This is to be firmly rooted, to have deep strength,|59|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The road to immortality and enduring vision.|59|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Rule a big country as you would fry small fish.|60|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Who rules the world in accord with Tao|60|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Shall find that the spirits lose their power.|60|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
It is not that the spirits lose their power,|60|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
But that they cease to do people harm.|60|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
It is not (only) that they cease to do people harm,|60|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The Sage (himself) also does no harm to the people.|60|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
When both do not do each other harm,|60|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The original character is restored.|60|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
A big country (should be like) the delta low-regions,|61|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Being the concourse of the world,|61|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
(And) the Female of the world.|61|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The Female overcomes the Male by quietude,|61|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
And achieves the lowly position by quietude.|61|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore if a big country places itself below a small country|61|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
It absorbs the small country.|61|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
(And) if a small country places itself below a big country,|61|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
It absorbs the big country.|61|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Therefore some place themselves low to absorb (others),|61|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Some are (naturally) low and absorb (others).|61|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
What a big country wants is but to shelter others,|61|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And what a small country wants is but to be able to|61|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
come in and be sheltered.|61|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Thus (considering) that both may have what they want,|61|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
A big country ought to place itself low.|61|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Tao is the mysterious secret of the universe,|62|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
The good man's treasure,|62|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And the bad man's refuge.|62|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Beautiful saying can be sold at the market,|62|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Noble conduct can be presented as a gift.|62|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Though there be bad people,|62|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Why reject them?|62|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore on the crowning of an emperor,|62|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
On the appointment of the Three Ministers,|62|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0
Rather than send tributes of jade and teams of four horses,|62|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Send in the tribute of Tao.|62|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Wherein did the ancients prize this Tao?|62|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
"Did they not say, ""to search for the guilty ones and pardon them""?"|62|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Therefore is (tao) the treasure of the world.|62|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Accomplish do-nothing.|63|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Attend to no-affairs.|63|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Taste the flavorless.|63|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Whether it is big or small, many or few,|63|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Requite hatred with virtue.|63|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Deal with the difficult while yet it is easy;|63|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Deal wit the big while yet it is small.|63|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The difficult (problems) of the world|63|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Must be dealt with while they are yet easy;|63|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The great (problems) of the world|63|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Must be dealt with while they are yet small.|63|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore the Sage by never dealing with great (problems)|63|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Accomplishes greatness.|63|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He who lightly makes a promise|63|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Will find it often hard to keep his faith.|63|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He who makes light of many things|63|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Will encounter many difficulties.|63|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Hence even the Sage regards things as difficult,|63|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And for that reason never meets with difficulties.|63|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
That which lies still is easy to hold;|64|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
That which is not yet manifest is easy to forestall;|64|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
That which is brittle (like ice) easily melts;|64|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
That which is minute easily scatters.|64|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Deal with a thing before it is there;|64|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Check disorder before it is rife.|64|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
A tree with a full span's girth begins from a tiny sprout;|64|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
A nine-storied terrace begins with a clod of earth.|64|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
A journey of a thousand li beings at one's feet.|64|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He who acts, spoils;|64|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He who grasps, lets slip.|64|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Because the Sage does not act, he does not spoil,|64|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Because he does not grasp, he does not let slip.|64|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The affairs of men are often spoiled within an ace of completion.|64|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
By being careful at the end as at the beginning|64|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Failure is averted.|64|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore the Sage desires to have no desire,|64|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
And values not objects difficult to obtain.|64|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Learns that which is unlearned,|64|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And restores what the multitude have lost.|64|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
That he may assist in the course of Nature|64|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And not presume to interfere.|64|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The ancients who knew how to follow the Tao|65|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Aimed not to enlighten the people.,|65|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
But to keep them ignorant.|65|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The reason it is difficult for the people to leave in peace|65|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Is because of too much knowledge.|65|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Those who seek to rule a country by knowledge|65|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Are the nation's curse.|65|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Those who seek not to rule a country by knowledge|65|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Are the nation's blessing.|65|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Those who know these two (principles)|65|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Also know the ancient standard,|65|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And to know always the ancient standard|65|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Is called the Mystic Virtue.|65|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
When the Mystic Virtue becomes clear, far-reaching,|65|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And things revert back (to their source)|65|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Then and then only emerges the Grand Harmony.|65|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
How did the great rivers and seas become the Lords|66|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
of the ravines?|66|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
By being good at keeping low.|66|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
That was how they became Lords of the Ravines.|66|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore in order to be the chief among the people,|66|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
One must speak like their inferiors.|66|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
In order to be foremost among the people,|66|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
One must walk behind them.|66|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Thus it is that the Sage stays above,|66|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And the people do not feel his weight;|66|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Walks in front,|66|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
And the people do not wish him harm.|66|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Then the people of the world are glad to uphold him forever.|66|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Because he does not contend,|66|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
No one in the world can contend against him.|66|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
All the world says: my teaching (Tao) greatly resembles folly.|67|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Because it is great; therefore it resembles folly.|67|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
If it did not resemble folly,|67|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
It would have long ago become petty indeed!|67|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
I have Three Treasures;|67|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Guard them and keep them safe:|67|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
the first is Love.|67|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The second is, Never too much.|67|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The third is, Never be the first in the world.|67|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Through Love, one has no fear;|67|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Through not doing too much, one has amplitude|67|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
(of reserve power);|67|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Through not presuming to be the first in the world,|67|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
One can develop one's talent and let it mature.|67|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
If one forsakes love and fearlessness,|67|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
forsakes restraint and reserve power,|67|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
forsakes following behind and rushes in front,|67|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
He is doomed!|67|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
For love is victorious in attack,|67|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
And invulnerable in defense.|67|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Heaven arms with love|67|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Those it would not see destroyed.|67|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The brave soldier is not violent;|68|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The good fighter does not lose his temper;|68|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The great conqueror does not fight (on small issues);|68|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
The good user of men places himself below others.|68|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
- This is the virtue of not-contending,|68|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Is called the capacity to use men,|68|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Is reaching to the height of being|68|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Mated to Heaven, to what was of old.|68|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
There is the maxim of military strategists;|69|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
I dare not be the first to invade, but rather be the invaded.|69|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Dare not press forward an inch, but rather retreat a foot.|69|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
That is, to march without formations,|69|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To roll up the sleeves,|69|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
To charge not in frontal attacks,|69|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To arm without weapons.|69|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
There is no greater catastrophe than to underestimate the enemy.|69|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To underestimate the enemy might entail the loss of my treasures.|69|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore when two equally matched armies meet,|69|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
It is the man of sorrow who wins.|69|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
My teachings are very easy to understand|70|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
and very easy to practice,|70|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
But no one can understand them and|70|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
no one can practice them.|70|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
In my words there is a principle.|70|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
In the affairs of men there is a system.|70|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Because they know not these,|70|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
They also know me not.|70|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Since there are few that know me,|70|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Therefore I am distinguished.|70|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore the Sage wears a coarse cloth on top|70|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
And carries jade within his bosom.|70|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Who knows that he does not know is the highest;|71|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Who (pretends to) know what he does not know is sick-minded.|71|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
And who recognizes sick-mindedness as sick-mindedness|71|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
is not sick-minded.|71|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The Sage is not sick-minded.|71|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Because he recognizes sick-mindedness as sick-mindness,|71|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore he is not sick-minded.|71|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
When people have no fear of force,|72|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Then (as is the common practice) great force descends upon them.|72|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Despise not their dwellings,|72|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Dislike not their progeny.|72|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Because you do not dislike them,|72|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
You will not be disliked yourself.|72|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore the Sage knows himself, but does not show himself,|72|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Loves himself, but does not exalt himself.|72|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore he rejects the one (force) and|72|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
accepts the other (gentility).|72|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Who is brave in daring (you) kill,|73|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Who is brave in not daring (you) let live.|73|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
In these two,|73|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
There is some advantage and some disadvantage.|73|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
(Even if) Heaven dislikes certain people,|73|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Who would know (who are to be killed and) why?|73|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore even the Sage regards it as a difficult question.|73|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Heaven's Way (Tao) is good at conquest without strife,|73|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Rewarding (vice and virtue) without words,|73|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Making its appearance without call,|73|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Achieving results without obvious design.|73|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The heaven's net is broad and wide.|73|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
With big meshes, yet letting nothing slip through.|73|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
The people are not afraid of death;|74|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Why threaten them with death?|74|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Supposing that the people are afraid of death,|74|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And we can seize and kill the unruly,|74|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Who would dare to do so?|74|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Often it happens that the executioner is killed.|74|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And to take the place of the executioner|74|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Is like handling the hatchet for the master carpenter.|74|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
He who handles the hatchet for the master carpenter|74|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
seldom escapes injury to his hands.|74|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
When people are hungry,|75|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
It is because their rulers eat too much tax-grain.|75|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Therefore the unruliness of hungry people|75|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Is due to the interference of their rulers.|75|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
That is why they are unruly.|75|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The people are not afraid of death,|75|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Because they are anxious to make a living.|75|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
That is why they are not afraid of death.|75|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
It is those who interfere not with their living|75|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
That are wise in exalting life.|75|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
When man is born, he is tender and weak;|76|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
At death, he is hard and stiff.|76|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
When the things and plants are alive, they are soft|76|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
and supple;|76|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
When they are dead, they are brittle and dry.|76|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Therefore hardness and stiffness are the companions of death,|76|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
And softness and gentleness are the companions of life.|76|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore when an army is headstrong, it will lose in a battle.|76|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
When a tree is hard, it will be cut down.|76|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The big and strong belong underneath.|76|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The gentle and weak belong at the top.|76|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The Tao (way) of Heaven,|77|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Is it not like the bending of a bow?|77|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
The top comes down and the bottom-end goes up,|77|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The extra (length) is shortened, the insufficient (width) is expanded.|77|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
It is the way of Heaven to take away from those that have too much|77|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And give to those that have not enough.|77|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Not so with man's way:|77|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
He takes from those that have not|77|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And gives it as tribute to those that have too much.|77|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Who can have enough and to spare to give to the entire world?|77|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Only the man of Tao.|77|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore the Sage acts, but does not possess,|77|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Accomplishes but lays claim to no credit,|77|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Because he has no wish to seem superior.|77|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
There is nothing weaker than water|78|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
But none is superior to it in overcoming the hard,|78|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
For which there is no substitute.|78|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
That weakness overcomes strength|78|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And gentleness overcomes rigidity,|78|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
No one does not know;|78|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
No one can put into practice.|78|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Therefore the Sage says:|78|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
"Who receives unto himself the calumny of the world|78
Is the preserver of the state.|78
Who bears himself the sins of the world|78
Is king of the world."|78|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Straight words seem crooked.|78|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Patching up a great hatred is sure to leave some hatred behind.|79|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
How can this be regarded as satisfactory?|79|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore the Sage holds the left tally,|79|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
And does not put the guilt on the other party.|79|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
the virtuous man is for patching up;|79|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The vicious is for fixing guilt.|79|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
"But ""the way of Heaven is impartial;"|79|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
"It sides only with the good man."""|79|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
(Let there be) a small country with a small population,|80|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Where the supply of goods are tenfold or hundredfold,|80|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
more than they can use.|80|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Let the people value their lives and not migrate far.|80|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Though there be boats and carriages,|80|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
None be there to ride them.|80|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0

No occasion to display them.|80|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Let the people again tie ropes for reckoning,|80|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Let them enjoy their food,|80|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Beautify their clothing,|80|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0

So that they can hear the barking of dogs and crowing|80|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
of cocks of their neighbors,|80|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0

True words are not fine-sounding;|81|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Fine-sounding words are not true.|81|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
A good man does not argue;|81|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
he who argues is not a good man.|81|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
the wise one does not know many things;|81|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
He who knows many things is not wise.|81|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The Sage does not accumulate (for himself).|81|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
He lives for other people,|81|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
