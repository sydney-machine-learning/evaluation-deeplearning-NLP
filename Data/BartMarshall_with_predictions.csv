That which can be perceived is not the timeless That.|1|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
That which can be named is not the nameless One.|1|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The source of heaven and earth is without form or substance.|1|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Naming creates the ten thousand things.|1|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
When desire is absent, the mystery is obvious.|1|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
When desire occurs, creation unfolds.|1|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Mystery and creation arise from the same source.|1|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
The source is emptiness.|1|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Void within void.|1|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The realm of Tao.|1|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Judging beauty creates ugliness.|2|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Defining good creates evil.|2|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
All and void arise together.|2|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Hard and soft,|2|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
long and short,|2|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
high and low,|2|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
sound and silence,|2|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
now and then.|2|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Opposites exist because of each other.|2|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Therefore the sage acts by not-doing and teaches no-thought.|2|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The ten thousand things arise and vanish without him.|2|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He works without motive,|2|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
indifferent to outcome.|2|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Because there is no doer,|2|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
his actions are timeless.|2|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Bestowing honor breeds ambitions.|3|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Hoarding treasure invites thieves.|3|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Displaying objects of desire sows the seeds of discontent.|3|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Therefore the sage governs|3|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
by emptying minds and filling bellies,|3|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
by weakening wills and strengthening bones.|3|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He extols the virtue of desireless unknowing|3|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
and keeps intellects off balance.|3|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
When not-doing is accomplished,|3|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
nothing remains undone.|3|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Tao is hollow emptiness.|4|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
The substance of All,|4|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
it is absent of substance.|4|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Dimensionless Void,|4|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
it is the source of the ten thousand things.|4|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
It blunts sharpness,|4|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
unravels entanglements,|4|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
diffuses brightness,|4|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
merges with dust.|4|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Dark, invisible, it only seems to be.|4|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
It is the child of no-thing|4|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
and the father of God.|4|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The realm of heaven and earth is indifferent to the myriad creatures.|5|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
They appear as straw dogs.|5|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The sage is indifferent to the multitudes of men.|5|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
They appear as straw dogs.|5|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The realm of heaven and earth is like a bellows,|5|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
both empty and full.|5|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Moving, it brings forth, endlessly.|5|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
More words, less understanding.|5|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Hold fast to the core.|5|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The urge of creation is ceaseless.|6|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
It is called the Dark Mother.|6|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The womb of the Dark Mother|6|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
is the ground of heaven and earth.|6|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Timeless, imperceptible,|6|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
it continues ever-present.|6|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Endless use does not touch it.|6|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The realm of heaven and earth is everlasting.|7|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Why is it everlasting?|7|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Because it is not conscious of itself.|7|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Having no thought of being, it never is not.|7|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Like this, the sage forgets himself|7|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
so is always present.|7|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Without self-concern,|7|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
the self is eternal.|7|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
When self-interest subsides,|7|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
fulfillment happens.|7|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Supreme virtue is like water.|8|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
It nourishes the ten thousand things without effort|8|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
and flows in places men shun.|8|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
It is like Tao.|8|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Stand on solid ground.|8|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Go deep into the heart.|8|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Speak only what is true.|8|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
In friendship, be kind.|8|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
In governing, be just.|8|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
In enterprise, be able.|8|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
In action, watch the timing.|8|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Do not contend with nature and nothing will go wrong.|8|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
An over-filled cup is difficult to carry.|9|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
An over-sharp point is easily broken.|9|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Fill your house with gold and jade|9|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
and it cannot be protected.|9|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Become puffed with pride|9|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
and disaster will follow.|9|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Do only what needs doing then forget it.|9|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
This is the way of heaven.|9|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
While maintaining a body|10|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
can you become One?|10|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
While breathing the force of life|10|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
can you be innocent as a babe?|10|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
While polishing the dark mirror|10|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
can you be without dust?|10|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
While loving and ruling the people|10|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
can you refrain from action?|10|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
While coming and going from heaven|10|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
can you be passive as a woman?|10|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Understanding all things|10|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
can you abide in unknowing?|10|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Give birth and nurture.|10|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Create without claim.|10|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Lead without taking command.|10|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
This is supreme virtue.|10|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Thirty spokes of the wheel converge|11|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
to define a hole.|11|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Clay is molded into pots|11|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
to shape emptiness.|11|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Walls are hammered into rooms|11|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
to enclosed space.|11|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Windows are cut into walls|11|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
to frame absence.|11|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Though things may have value,|11|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
without no-thing they are useless.|11|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The five colors confuse the eye.|12|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The five tones deaden the ear.|12|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
The five flavors dull the palette.|12|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Racing and hunting madden the mind.|12|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Valuable goods hinder movement.|12|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Therefore the sage is guided by his gut, not his senses.|12|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
He attends to one and ignores the other.|12|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Receive honor with dismay.|13|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Accept misfortune gratefully.|13|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Why receive honor with dismay?|13|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Honor and dishonor cause the same disturbance.|13|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
With honor comes the fear of disgrace.|13|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
With disgrace comes anxiety and dread.|13|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Why accept misfortune gratefully?|13|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Misfortune weakens the bond to body and self.|13|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Without a separate self, what misfortune is possible?|13|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
See misfortune as a condition of separation,|13|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
and you will become whole.|13|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
See the world as your body, and all will be delivered unto you.|13|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Searching, we cannot see it.|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
We call it ephemeral.|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Straining, we cannot hear it.|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
We call it ethereal.|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Reaching, we cannot grasp it.|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
We call it intangible.|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
These three are often confused|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
because they are the same.|14|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The One is not bright above and dark below.|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Transparent, it moves in and out of nothing.|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Its form has no shape.|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Its image has no substance.|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
It is indistinct, elusive.|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0

Now is the ancient beginning.|14|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The old masters were deep, unfathomable,|15|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
profound beyond understanding.|15|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Because they were unfathomable|15|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
we can only describe their demeanor.|15|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Cautious, as if crossing an icy stream.|15|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Alert, as if sensing danger.|15|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Respectful, like visiting guests.|15|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Yielding, like melting ice.|15|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Simple, like uncarved wood.|15|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Open, like beckoning valleys.|15|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Mysterious, like opaque pools.|15|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Still the mind and the mud settles.|15|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Do nothing and action comes of itself.|15|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
One who embraces Tao has no desire for fulfillment.|15|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Not desiring fulfillment, he is finished with birth and death.|15|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Be completely empty.|16|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Be completely still.|16|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Witness the ten thousand things|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
appear and vanish in one motion.|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Watch as they arise, linger,|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
and return to the source—stillness.|16|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
This is the way it is.|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
It is called everlasting life.|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To witness the everlasting is to be awake.|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Not seeing the everlasting, one engages in blind action.|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Blind action leads to misfortune.|16|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Seeing the everlasting, one encompasses all.|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Encompassing all, one is impartial.|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Being impartial, one acts nobly.|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Acting nobly, one enters heaven.|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Entering heaven is to be one with Tao.|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0

Lesser rulers are praised and loved.|17|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Lesser still are feared and obeyed.|17|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The least are ridiculed and despised.|17|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Trust is earned by trusting.|17|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The sage uses words sparingly.|17|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
His work is done without fanfare.|17|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
People say: “It happened by itself.”|17|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
When Tao is forgotten,|18|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
charity and righteousness are born.|18|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
When intelligence and knowledge are valued,|18|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
duplicity and pretense soon follow.|18|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
When the family is discordant,|18|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
love and duty are preached.|18|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
When the country is in chaos,|18|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
loyal patriots appear.|18|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Abandon holiness, renounce wisdom.|19|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
It will be a hundred times better for everyone.|19|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Eliminate morality and benevolence.|19|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Love and empathy will naturally return.|19|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Give up cleverness and profit.|19|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Thieves and bandits will disappear.|19|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
But those are outward lessons, not the core.|19|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Be simple.|19|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0

Between yes and no, is there really much difference?|20|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Good and bad, are they so far apart?|20|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Must I think as others think?|20|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0

I alone am unmoved, like an infant too young to smile.|20|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Others have more than enough.|20|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
I alone have nothing.|20|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
My mind is that of a fool—empty.|20|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Others are clear and bright.|20|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0

directionless as swirling wind.|20|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Everyone else has purpose.|20|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
I alone am stubborn and untamed.|20|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
I am different.|20|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
I am nourished by the Dark Mother.|20|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Supreme virtue is to abide in Tao alone.|21|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Tao is elusive and empty—|21|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
oh yes, utterly empty and elusive—|21|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
yet within it dreamlike images arise.|21|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Oh yes, it is indistinct and nebulous,|21|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|1.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
but within it shadows take form.|21|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Oh yes, it is mysterious and dark,|21|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
but within it appearances originate.|21|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
The origin of creation is the real.|21|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Its manifestations are unceasing.|21|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
This can be witnessed.|21|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
How do I witness the origin of creation?|21|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
By looking!|21|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Surrender and become whole.|22|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Bend low and be straightened.|22|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0

Having nothing, beauty is revealed.|22|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Having much, the way is hidden.|22|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The sage abides in One|22|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
and thus is master of heaven and earth.|22|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Not being self-absorbed, his vision is clear.|22|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Not asserting himself, his light shines forth.|22|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Not showing off, his merit is obvious.|22|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Not praising himself, praise is showered upon him.|22|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Not contending, nothing under heaven stands in his way.|22|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
This ancient saying, “Surrender and become whole,”|22|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
is it empty words?|22|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Being whole means all things have returned to you.|22|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To speak a short time is the way of nature.|23|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0

The realm of heaven and earth.|23|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0

The uncarved block appears as separate things.|28|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The sage sees things as they are and rules the world.|28|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Great power does not divide.|28|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
There are those who want to control the realm|29|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0

It cannot be improved.|29|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He who tries to change it, destroys it for himself.|29|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He who tries to hold it, loses all contact.|29|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
It is natural for beings to sometimes lead, sometimes follow,|29|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
sometimes breathe hot, sometimes blow cold.|29|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0

He does not abuse position.|30|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Achieve results, but do not glory in them.|30|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Achieve results, but do not boast.|30|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Achieve results, but be not proud.|30|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0

Doing more than necessary brings exhaustion.|30|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0

Weapons are not the tools of a man of virtue.|31|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Weapons are instruments of ill omen,|31|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
to be employed as a last resort.|31|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Do not relish their use|31|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
or admire their excellence.|31|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To see weapons as excellent is to relish killing.|31|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
If you relish killing you will never find the way.|31|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
On joyful occasions, precedence is given to the left.|31|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
On sad occasions, precedence is given to the right.|31|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0

The commander is placed on the right.|31|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0

left and right, all directions.|34|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The ten thousand things depend on it|34|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
and it does not turn away.|34|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Its purpose is fulfilled but it lays no claim.|34|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
It clothes and nourishes the ten thousand things|34|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
but is not their lord.|34|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
It desires nothing.|34|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
It is smaller than small.|34|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
The ten thousand things return to it|34|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
but it is not their master.|34|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
It is indeed great.|34|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Because it knows nothing of greatness,|34|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
it is greater than great.|34|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Extol the great illusion|35|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0

the clearness of heaven would vanish,|39|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0

Tao moves by returning and acts by yielding.|40|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0

Being arises from non-being.|40|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0

he practices off and on.|41|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
When the foolish student hears of Tao|41|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
he laughs out loud.|41|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
If the foolish do not laugh, it is not Tao.|41|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0

The perfect form has no shape.|41|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Tao is unseen, undefined.|41|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Yet Tao alone nourishes|41|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
and brings all things to fulfillment.|41|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
From Tao, One arises.|42|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
From One, two.|42|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
From two, three.|42|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Three becomes the ten thousand things.|42|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The ten thousand things carry yin on their backs|42|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
and hold yang in their arms.|42|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Existence depends on the two.|42|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Men hate to be orphaned, bereft, unworthy,|42|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
yet this is how the noble man describes himself.|42|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Loss is gain, gain is loss.|42|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
I teach what has always been taught:|42|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
A fervent man is surprised by death.|42|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
I see this as the foundation of my teaching.|42|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Under heaven, the soft and yielding|43|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
overcomes the hard and strong.|43|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
That without substance permeates the impenetrable.|43|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Thus, I embrace non-action.|43|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Teach without words.|43|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Work without doing.|43|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Few under heaven understand this.|43|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Name or person, which is more dear?|44|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Person or possessions, which is more precious?|44|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Gain or loss, which is more harmful?|44|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Excessive desire incurs great expense.|44|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
One who hoards treasure suffers loss.|44|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
One who knows enough is enough|44|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
will always have enough.|44|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
One who knows when to stop avoids exhaustion.|44|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Thus, he will endure.|44|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Perfection appears imperfect|45|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
but has no flaw.|45|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Fulfillment appears as emptiness|45|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
but has no limit.|45|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Great truth is a paradox.|45|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Great wisdom is self-evident.|45|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Great eloquence is unpracticed.|45|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Movement overcomes cold.|45|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Stillness overcomes heat.|45|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Stillness and simplicity put all things right under heaven.|45|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
When Tao is embraced in the realm,|46|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
race horses haul their own manure.|46|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
When Tao is unknown in the realm,|46|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
war horses are bred at the borders.|46|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
There is no greater curse than desire,|46|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
no greater misfortune than greed.|46|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He who knows enough is enough|46|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
will always have enough.|46|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0

When government does not interfere, the people are genuine.|58|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
When government intrudes, the people are cunning.|58|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Happiness is founded on misery.|58|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Misery lurks within happiness.|58|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Is there an end to it?|58|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Nothing stays the same.|58|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Honesty moves with deceit.|58|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Good flows with evil.|58|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
But people's delusion persists.|58|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Thus, the sage is sharp but not divisive,|58|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
straightforward but not hurtful,|58|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
principled but not severe,|58|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
illumined but not blinding.|58|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
In leading people and serving heaven,|59|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
nothing surpasses humility.|59|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Humility is having no preferences.|59|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Humility accumulates virtue.|59|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Where virtue accumulates, nothing is impossible.|59|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
When nothing is impossible, there are no limits.|59|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
A man without limits is fit to rule the realm.|59|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The mother of the realm is everlasting.|59|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
This is called being deeply rooted.|59|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Timeless awareness of Tao.|59|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Governing a country is like cooking a delicate fish.|60|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Rule in observance of Tao|60|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
and the forces of adversity become harmless.|60|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
They do not lose their power,|60|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
only their power to harm.|60|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The sage, too, does no harm|60|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
and so he is not harmed.|60|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Virtue flows unimpeded.|60|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
A country becomes great by lying low,|61|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
like the delta of a great river.|61|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
The confluence of the realm.|61|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
The mother of the world.|61|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The female conquers the male by stillness.|61|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Being still, she takes the lower position.|61|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
A great country conquers a small country|61|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
by taking the lower position.|61|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
A small country conquers a great country|61|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
by merging with it.|61|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Thus, the great country conquers by yielding,|61|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
the small country conquers by being absorbed.|61|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The great country needs more people.|61|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The small country needs greater purpose.|61|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Each gets what it needs.|61|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
It is proper for greatness to yield.|61|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Tao is the ground of the ten thousand things.|62|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
It is the refuge of the good man|62|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
and the guardian of the bad.|62|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Fine speech can buy high rank.|62|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Good deeds can earn respect.|62|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Should one without them be abandoned?|62|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore, on the day the son is crowned|62|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
and the three ministers named,|62|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
do not send gifts of jade and teams of horses.|62|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Remain still and offer Tao.|62|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Why has Tao been honored since ancient times?|62|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Seek and you will find; transgress and you will be forgiven.|62|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Is this not the reason?|62|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Above all else, observe Tao.|62|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Perform not-doing.|63|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0

See greatness in small gestures.|63|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Confront the difficult while easy.|63|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Do great things in small increments.|63|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The sage does nothing great,|63|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
but great things are accomplished.|63|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Easy promises are easily broken.|63|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Things taken lightly become difficult.|63|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The sage regards nothing lightly,|63|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
therefore nothing is difficult.|63|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
That which is still is easy to contain.|64|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
What has not yet begun is easy to prevent.|64|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0

A tree trunk that fills a man's arms|64|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0

A terrace nine stories high|64|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0

A journey of a thousand miles|64|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0

Those who strive meet defeat.|64|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Those who grasp lose their grip.|64|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The sage does nothing and never fails.|64|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He has nothing and never loses.|64|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Failure often comes on the verge of success.|64|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Be as careful in the end as the beginning|64|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
and there will be no failure.|64|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The sage desires no-desire.|64|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
He does not value wealth.|64|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He learns by not thinking.|64|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He restores to others what has been lost.|64|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He helps the ten thousand things return to original nature|64|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
but does not interfere.|64|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The ancient observers of Tao did not teach it to others.|65|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
They let them remain simple and unknowing.|65|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
People are difficult to deal with when they think they know.|65|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Leaders who think they know are a curse to those they lead.|65|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Leaders with a simple heart are a blessing to all.|65|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Both are manifestations of the same truth.|65|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Knowing the truth is Virtue.|65|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Virtue is mysterious, profound, far reaching.|65|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Reaching far, it returns to itself and is complete.|65|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Rivers rule valleys and seas rule rivers|66|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
because they take the lower position.|66|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
The sage is elevated by placing himself below others.|66|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He leads by leaving himself behind.|66|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
When he assumes high position, the people do not feel his weight.|66|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
When he rules they do not feel threatened.|66|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The realm rejoices and never tires of his presence.|66|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Because he does not contend, nothing stands against him.|66|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Everyone agrees the Tao I teach is great, yet unlike anything else.|67|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Indeed, if it were not singular it would not endure.|67|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
I hold three treasures close:|67|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The first is unconditional regard for all.|67|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The second is being content with little.|67|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The third is not placing myself before others.|67|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
From compassion comes courage.|67|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
From contentment comes an open heart.|67|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
From humility comes the capacity to lead.|67|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Daring without mercy,|67|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
giving without generosity,|67|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
ruling without modesty,|67|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
this is the way of death.|67|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Attacking with compassion, you are victorious.|67|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Defending with compassion, you are impregnable.|67|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
What heaven favors it infuses with compassion.|67|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
A good general is not aggressive.|68|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
A good warrior is not wrathful.|68|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
A skillful conqueror does not instigate battle.|68|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
A skillful employer serves those under him.|68|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
This is the virtue of not contending.|68|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
This is mastering the strength of others.|68|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
This is being in accord with the principles of heaven.|68|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Skillful warriors have a saying:|69|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
"Do not move first, play the guest.|69
Do not move forward an inch, retreat a foot."|69|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
This is called advancing without moving.|69|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Reaching without showing one's arms.|69|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Capturing without attacking.|69|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Doing battle without weapons.|69|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
There is no greater mistake than underestimating the enemy.|69|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Underestimating the enemy, I risk losing everything of value.|69|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Thus, when equal opponents are matched,|69|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
the one aware of sorrow will prevail.|69|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
What I teach is easy to understand and practice,|70|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
yet no one understands it or puts it to practice.|70|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
My words are from the source.|70|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
My actions are those of the ancestor.|70|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
People do not understand this.|70|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore, they do not understand me.|70|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Those who see me as I am are rare.|70|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Those who seek to follow my teachings are few.|70|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The sage wears coarse clothing|70|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
but carries jade in his pockets.|70|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
To know that you do not know is clarity.|71|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To think that you know is sickness.|71|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Being sick of sickness, one attains clarity.|71|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The sage is sick of sickness.|71|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore, he is clear.|71|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
When people do not respect power,|72|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
disaster is on the horizon.|72|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Do not limit their space.|72|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Do not disrupt their lives.|72|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Do not oppress them|72|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
and they will not tire of you.|72|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The sage knows himself, but does not claim knowledge.|72|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
He loves himself, but does not feel important.|72|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He lets go of that and chooses this.|72|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
A courageous and reckless man will kill or be killed.|73|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
A courageous and careful man preserves life.|73|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Of the two, which is beneficial and which brings harm?|73|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Who knows what heaven favors.|73|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Even the sage is unsure.|73|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
The way of heaven does not contend, yet overcomes.|73|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Does not speak, yet converses.|73|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Without being summoned it comes of its own,|73|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
unhurried, and according to plan.|73|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The net of heaven is vast.|73|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Though the mesh is wide, nothing slips through.|73|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
If people are not afraid of death,|74|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
why threaten them with death?|74|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
If people are in constant fear of death,|74|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
and if being unruly means you will be killed,|74|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
who would dare be unruly?|74|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Who would dare kill him?|74|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
There is always a lord of death.|74|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Trying to do his job is like|74|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
taking the place of an artisan.|74|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
He who tries to carve like a master carpenter|74|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
rarely avoids being cut.|74|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Why are the people starving?|75|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The government takes their grain for taxes.|75|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Therefore they are starving.|75|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Why are the people rebellious?|75|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
The government interferes in their lives.|75|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore they are rebellious.|75|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Why do people ignore the gravity of death?|75|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
They are consumed by the intensity of life.|75|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Therefore they ignore the gravity of death.|75|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
One who is not consumed by life|75|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
is better off than one who values it.|75|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
A man is born supple and soft.|76|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
At death he is rigid and hard.|76|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The ten thousand things, the grass, the trees,|76|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
while living are tender and pliant.|76|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
In death they are dry and withered.|76|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The hard and unbending are companions of death.|76|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The soft and yielding are companions of life.|76|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Thus, an inflexible army is easily defeated.|76|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
An unbending tree is easily broken.|76|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
The hard and strong are laid low.|76|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
The soft and yielding are raised up.|76|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The way of heaven, is it not like the stringing of a bow?|77|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
The high end is lowered, the low is raised up.|77|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
If the string is too long it is shortened.|77|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
If the string is too short it is lengthened.|77|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The way of heaven takes from the excessive|77|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
and gives to the insufficient.|77|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The way of man is different.|77|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Those with too much take from those who have little.|77|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Who keeps just enough and gives the rest to the world?|77|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Only observers of Tao.|77|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The sage works without expectation.|77|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Achieves without taking credit.|77|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He does not desire to seem worthy.|77|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
In all the world nothing is softer and weaker than water.|78|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Yet for overcoming the hard and strong it is unequaled.|78|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The pliant overcomes the unbending.|78|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The submissive overcomes the unyielding.|78|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Everyone knows this but no one puts it into practice.|78|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Therefore the sage says:|78|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
He who takes on the suffering of the world is fit to rule it.|78|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
One who accepts the evils of the world as his own|78|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
is a king under heaven.|78|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Truth is often a paradox.|78|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
When bitter quarrels are settled,|79|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
enmity is sure to remain.|79|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
What can be done?|79|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
A man of virtue pays his debts|79|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
but does not exact his due.|79|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He fulfills his obligations|79|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
but makes no demands.|79|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The Tao of heaven plays no favorites.|79|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
It flows with Virtue.|79|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Let the state be small.|80|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Let the people be few.|80|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Though they have equipment to arm ten battalions|80|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
they do not do it.|80|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
They take death seriously and do not venture far.|80|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
They have ships and carts|80|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
but there is no place they want to go.|80|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
They have armor and weapons|80|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
but they are not displayed.|80|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Men return to knotting rope.|80|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
They enjoy their meals and are comfortable in their clothes.|80|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
They are content in their homes and happy with their lives.|80|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Though the neighboring state is so close|80|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
you can hear the cocks and dogs,|80|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
they leave each other in peace as they grow old and die.|80|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Truth is not eloquent.|81|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Eloquence is not truth.|81|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Wise men do not try to persuade.|81|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Whoever tries to persuade is not wise.|81|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
One who knows, claims unknowing.|81|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
One who claims knowledge, does not know.|81|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The sage does not acquire.|81|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
He bestows what he has on others|81|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
and always has more.|81|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The more he gives, the greater his abundance.|81|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The way of heaven is to give without harm.|81|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
