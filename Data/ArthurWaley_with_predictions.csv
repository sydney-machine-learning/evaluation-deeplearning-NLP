The Way that can be told of is not an Unvarying Way;|1|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
The names that can be named are not unvarying names.|1|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
It was from the Nameless that Heaven and Earth sprang;|1|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The named is but the mother that rears the ten thousand creatures, each after its kind.|1|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Truly, “Only he that rids himself forever of desire can see the Secret Essences”;|1|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
He that has never rid himself of desire can see only the Outcomes.|1|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
These two things issued from the same mould, but nevertheless are different in name.|1|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
This “same mould” we can but call the Mystery,|1|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Or rather the “Darker than any Mystery”,|1|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
The Doorway whence issued all Secret Essences.|1|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
It is because every one under Heaven recognizes beauty as beauty,|2|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
That the idea of ugliness exists.|2|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
And equally if every one recognized virtue as virtue,|2|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
this would merely create fresh conceptions of wickedness.|2|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
For truly, Being and Not-being grow out of one another;|2|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Difficult and easy complete one another.|2|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Long and short test one another;|2|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
High and low determine one another.|2|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Pitch and mode give harmony to one another.|2|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Front and back give sequence to one another.|2|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore the Sage relies on actionless activity,|2|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Carries on wordless teaching,|2|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
But the myriad creatures are worked upon by him;|2|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He does not disown them.|2|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He rears them, but does not lay claim to them,|2|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Controls them, but does not lean upon them,|2|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Achieves his aim, but does not call attention to what he does;|2|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And for the very reason that he does not call attention to what he does|2|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
He is not ejected from fruition of what he has done.|2|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
If we stop looking for “persons of superior morality” (hsien) to put in power,|3|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
There will be no more jealousies among the people.|3|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
If we cease to set store by products that are hard to get,|3|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
There will be no more thieves.|3|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
If the people never see such things as excite desire,|3|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Their hearts will remain placid and undisturbed.|3|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore the Sage rules|3|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
By emptying their hearts|3|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And filling their hearts?|3|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Weakening their intelligence|3|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And toughening their sinews|3|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Ever striving to make the people knowledgeless and desireless.|3|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Indeed he sees to it that if there be any who have knowledge,|3|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
They dare not interfere.|3|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Yet through his actionless activity all things are duly regulated.|3|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The Way is like an empty vessel|4|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
That yet may be drawn from|4|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Without ever needing to be filled.|4|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
It is bottomless; the very progenitor of all things in the world.|4|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
In it all sharpness is blunted,|4|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
All tangles untied,|4|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
All glare tempered,|4|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
All dust soothed.|4|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
It is like a deep pool that never dries.|4|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Was it too the child of something else?|4|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
We cannot tell.|4|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
But as a substanceless image it existed before the Ancestor.|4|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Heaven and Earth are ruthless;|5|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To them the Ten Thousand things are but as straw dogs.|5|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The Sage too is ruthless;|5|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
To him the people are but as straw dogs.|5|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Yet Heaven and Earth and all that lies between|5|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Is like a bellows|5|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
In that it is empty, but gives a supply that never fails.|5|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Work it, and more comes out.|5|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Whereas the force of words is soon spent.|5|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Far better is it to keep what is in the heart.|5|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The Valley Spirit never dies.|6|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
It is named the Mysterious Female.|6|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
And the doorway of the Mysterious Female|6|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Is the base from which Heaven and Earth sprang.|6|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
It is there within us all the while;|6|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Draw upon it as you will, it never runs dry.|6|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Heaven is eternal, the Earth everlasting.|7|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
How come they to be so?|7|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
It is because they do not foster their own lives;|7|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
That is why they live so long.|7|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore the Sage|7|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Puts himself in the background; but is always to the fore.|7|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Remains outside; but is always there.|7|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Is it not just because he does not strive for any personal end|7|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
That all his personal ends are fulfilled?|7|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
The highest good is like that of water.|8|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The goodness of is that it benefits the ten thousand creatures;|8|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Yet itself does not scramble,|8|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
But is content with the places that all men disdain.|8|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
It is this makes water so near to the Way.|8|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And if men think the ground the best place for building a house upon,|8|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
If among thoughts they value those that are profound,|8|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
If in friendship they value gentleness,|8|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
In words, truth; in government, good order;|8|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
In deeds, effectiveness; in actions, timeliness -|8|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
In each case it is because they prefer what does not lead to strife,|8|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
And therefore does not go amiss.|8|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Stretch a bow to the very full,|9|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
And you will wish you had stopped in time;|9|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Temper a sword-edge to its very sharpest,|9|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And you will find it soon grows dull.|9|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
When bronze and jade fill your hall.|9|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
It can no longer be guarded.|9|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Wealth and place breed insolence.|9|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
That brings ruin in its train.|9|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
When your work is done, then withdraw!|9|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Such is Heaven's Way.|9|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Can you keep the unquiet physical-soul from straying,|10|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Hold fast to the Unity, and never quit it?|10|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Can you, when concentrating your breath,|10|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Make it soft like that of a little child?|10|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Can you wipe and cleanse your vision of the Mystery till all is without blur?|10|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Can you love the people and rule the land,|10|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Yet remain unknown?|10|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Can you in opening and shutting the heavenly gates play always the female part?|10|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Can your mind penetrate every corner of the land,|10|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
But you yourself never interfere?|10|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Rear them, then, feed them,|10|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Rear them, but do not lay claim to them.|10|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Control them, but never lean upon them;|10|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Be chief among them, but do not manage them.|10|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
This is called the Mysterious Power.|10|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
We put thirty spokes together and call it a wheel;|11|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
But it is on the space where there is nothing|11|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
That the usefulness of the wheel depends.|11|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
We turn clay to make a vessel;|11|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
But it is on the space where there is nothing|11|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
That the usefulness of the vessel depends.|11|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
We pierce doors and windows to make a house;|11|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
And it is on these spaces where there is nothing|11|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
That the usefulness of the house depends.|11|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Therefore just as we take advantage of what is,|11|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
We should recognize the usefulness of what is not.|11|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The fives colours confuse the eye,|12|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The fives sounds dull the ear,|12|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The five tastes spoil the palate.|12|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Excess of hunting and chasing|12|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Makes minds go mad.|12|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Products that are hard to get|12|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Impede their owner's movements.|12|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Therefore the Sage|12|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Considers the belly not the eye.|12|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Truly, “he rejects that but takes this”.|12|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Favour and disgrace goad as it were to madness;|13|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
High rank hurts keenly as our bodies hurt.”|13|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
What does it mean to say that favour and disgrace goad as it were to madness?|13|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
It means that when a rule's subjects get it they turn distraught,|13|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
When they lose it they turn distraught.|13|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
That is what is meant to by saying favour and disgrace goad as it were to madness.|13|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
What does it mean to say that high rank hurts keenly as our bodies hurt?|13|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The only reason that we suffer hurt is that we have bodies;|13|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
If we had no bodies, how could we suffer?|13|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore we may accept the saying:|13|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
“He who in dealing with the empire regards his high rank|13|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
As through it were his body is the best person to be entrusted with rules;|13|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He who in dealing with the empire loves his subjects as one should love one's body|13|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Is the best person to whom one commit the empire.”|13|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Because the eye gazes but can catch no glimpse of it,|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
It is called elusive.|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Because the ear listens but cannot hear it,|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
It is called the rarefied.|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Because the hand feels for it but cannot find it,|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
It is called the infinitesimal.|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
These three, because they cannot be further scrutinized,|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Blend into one,|14|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Its rising brings no light;|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Its sinking, no darkness.|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Endless the series of things without name|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
On the way back to where there is nothing.|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
They are called shapeless shapes;|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Forms without form;|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Are called vague semblance.|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Go towards them, and you can see no front;|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Go after them, and you see no rear.|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Yet by seizing on the Way that was|14|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
You can ride the things that are now.|14|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
For to know what once there was, in the Beginning,|14|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
This is called the essence of the Way.|14|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Of old those that were the best officers of Court|15|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Had inner natures subtle, abstruse, mysterious, penetrating,|15|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Too deep to be understood.|15|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And because such men could not be understood|15|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
I can but tell of them as they appeared to the world:|15|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Circumspect they seemed, like one who in winter crosses a stream,|15|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Watchful, as one who must meet danger on every side.|15|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Ceremonious, as one who pays a visit;|15|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Yet yielding, as ice when it begins to melt.|15|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Blank, as a piece of uncarved wood;|15|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Yet receptive as a hollow in the hills.|15|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Murky, as a troubled stream —–|15|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
(Tranquil, as the vast reaches of the sea,|15|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Drifting as the wind with no stop.)|15|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Which of you an assume such murkiness,|15|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
To become in the end still and clear?|15|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Which of you can make yourself insert,|15|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
To become in the end full of life and stir?|15|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Those who possess this Tao do not try to fill themselves to the brim,|15|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And because they do not try to fill themselves to the brim,|15|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
They are like a garment that endures all wear and need never be renewed.|15|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Push far enough towards the Void,|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Hold fast enough to Quietness,|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And of the ten thousand things none but can be worked on by you.|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
I have beheld them, whither they go back.|16|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
See, all things howsoever they flourish|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Return to the root from which they grew.|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
This return to the root is called Quietness;|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Quietness is called submission to Fate;|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
What has submitted to Fate has become part of the always so.|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To know the always-so is to be Illumined;|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Not to know it, means to go blindly to disaster.|16|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He who knows the always-so has room in him for everything;|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He who has room in him for everything is without prejudice.|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To be without prejudice is to be kingly;|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
To be kingly is to be of heaven;|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To be of heaven is to be in Tao.|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Tao is forever and he that possess it,|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Though his body ceases, is not destroyed.|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Of the highest the people merely know that such a one exists;|17|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The next they draw near to and praise.|17|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The next they shrink from, intimidated; but revile.|17|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Truly, “It is by not believing people that you turn them into liars”.|17|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
But from the Sage it is so hard at any price to get a single word|17|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
That when his task is accomplished, his work done,|17|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Throughout the country every one says: “It happened of its own accord”.|17|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
It was when the Great Way declined|18|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
That human kindness and morality arose;|18|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
It was when intelligence and knowledge appeared|18|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
That the Great Artifice began.|18|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
It was when the six near ones were no longer at peace|18|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
That there was talk of “dutiful sons”;|18|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Nor till fatherland was dark with strife|18|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Did we hear of “loyal slaves”.|18|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Banish wisdom, discard knowledge,|19|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And the people will be benefited a hundredfold.|19|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Banish human kindness, discard morality,|19|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And the people will be dutiful and compassionate.|19|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Banish skill, discard profit,|19|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And thieves and robbers will disappear.|19|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
If when these three things are done they find life too plain and unadorned,|19|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Then let them have accessories;|19|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Give them Simplicity to look at, the Uncarved Black to hold,|19|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Give them selflessness and fewness of desires.|19|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Banish learning, and there will be no more grieving.|19|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Between wei and o|20|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
What after all is the difference?|20|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Can it be compared to the difference between good and bad?|20|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
The saying “what others avoid I too must avoid”|20|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
How false and superficial it is?|20|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
All men, indeed, are wreathed in smiles,|20|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
As though feasting after the Great Sacrifice,|20|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
As though going up to the Spring Carnival.|20|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
I alone am inert, like a child that has not yet given sign;|20|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Like an infant that has not yet smiled.|20|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
I droop and drift, as though I belonged nowhere.|20|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
All men have enough and to spare;|20|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
I alone seem to have lost everything.|20|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Mine is indeed the mind of a very idiot,|20|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
So dull am I.|20|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The world is full of people that shine;|20|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
I alone am dark.|20|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
They look lively and self-assured;|20|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
I alone depressed.|20|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
(I seem unsettled as the ocean;|20|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Blown adrift, never brought to a stop.)|20|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
All men can be put to some use;|20|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
I alone am intractable and boorish.|20|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
But wherein I most am different from men|20|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Is that I prize no sustenance that comes not from the Mother's breast.|20|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Such the scope of the All-pervading Power.|21|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
That it alone can act through the Way.|21|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
For the Way is a thing impalpable, incommensurable.|21|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Incommensurable, impalpable.|21|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Yet latent in it are forms;|21|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Impalpable, incommensurable|21|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Yet within it are entities.|21|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Shadowy it is and dim;|21|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Yet within it there is a force,|21|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Is none the less efficacious.|21|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
From the times of old till now|21|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Its charge has not departed|21|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
But cheers onward the many warriors.|21|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
How do I know that the many warriors are so?|21|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0

“To remain whole, be twisted!”|22|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To become straight, let yourself be bent.|22|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
To become full, be hollow.|22|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Be tattered, that you may be renewed.|22|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Those that have little, may get more,|22|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Those that have much, are but perplexed.|22|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore the ; Sage|22|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Clasps the Primal Unity,|22|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Testing by it everything under heaven.|22|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He does not show himself; therefore he seen everywhere.|22|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
He does not define himself, therefore he is distinct.|22|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He does not boast of what he will do, therefore he succeeds.|22|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He is not proud of his work, and therefore it endures.|22|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He does not contend,|22|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
And for that very reason no one under heaven can contend with him.|22|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
So then we see that the ancient saying “To remain whole, be twisted!” was no idle word;|22|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
For true wholeness can only be achieved by return.|22|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To be always talks is against nature.|23|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
For the same reason a hurricane never lasts a whole morning,|23|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Nor a rainstorm all day.|23|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Who is it that makes the wind and rain?|23|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
It is Heaven-and Earth.|23|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And if even Heaven-and Earth cannot blow or pour for long,|23|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
How much less in his utterance should man?|23|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Truly, if one uses the Way as one's instrument,|23|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The results will be like the Way;|23|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
If one uses the “power” as instrument,|23|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
The results will be like the “power”.|23|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
If one uses what is the reverse of the “power”,|23|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
The results will be the reverse of the “power”.|23|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
For to those who have conformed themselves to the Way,|23|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The Way readily lends its power.|23|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To those who have conformed themselves to the power,|23|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The power readily, lends more power.|23|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
While to those who conform themselves to inefficacy,|23|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Inefficacy readily lends its ineffectiveness.|23|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
“It is by not believing in people that you turn them into liars.”|23|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
'He who stands on tip-toe, does not stand firm;|24|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He who takes the longest strides, does not walk the fastest.”|24|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
He who does his own looking sees little,|24|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He who defines himself is not therefore distinct.|24|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He who boasts of what he will do succeeds in nothing;|24|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He who is proud of his work, achieves nothing that endures.|24|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Of these, from the standpoint of the Way, it is said:|24|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
“Pass round superfluous dishes to those that have already had enough,|24|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
And no creature but will reject them in disgust.”|24|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
That is why he that possesses Tao does not linger.|24|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
There was something formless yet complete,|25|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
That existed before heaven and earth;|25|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Without sound, without substance,|25|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Dependent on nothing, unchanging,|25|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
All pervading, unfailing.|25|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
One may think of it as the mother of all things under heaven.|25|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Its true name we do not know;|25|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Were I forced to say to what class of things it belongs|25|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
I should call it Great (ta)|25|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Now ta also means passing on,|25|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
And passing on means going Far Away,|25|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
And going far away means returning.|25|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Thus just as Tao has “this greatness” and as earth has it and as heaven has it,|25|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
So may the ruler also have it.|25|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Thus “within the realm there are four portions of greatness”,|25|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And one belongs to the king.|25|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The ways of men are conditioned by those of earth.|25|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The ways of earth, by those of heaven.|25|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The ways of heaven by those of Tao, and the ways of Tao by the Self-so.|25|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
As the heavy must be the foundation of the light,|26|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
So quietness is lord and master of activity.|26|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Truly, “A man of consequence though he travels all day|26|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Will not let himself be separated from his baggage-wagon,|26|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
However magnificent the view, he sits quiet and dispassionate”.|26|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
How much less, then, must be the lord of ten thousand chariots|26|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Allow himself to be lighter than these he rules!|26|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
If he is light, the foundation is lost;|26|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
If he is active, the lord and master is lost.|26|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Perfect activity leaves no track behind it;|27|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Perfect speech is like a jade-worker whose tool leaves no mark.|27|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The perfect reckoner needs no counting-slips;|27|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The perfect door has neither bolt nor bar,|27|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Yet cannot be opened.|27|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The perfect knot needs neither rope nor twine,|27|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Yet cannot be united.|27|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore the Sage|27|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Is all the time in the most perfect way helping men,|27|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He certainly does not turn his back on men;|27|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Is all the time in the most perfect way helping creatures,|27|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He certainly does not turn his back on creatures.|27|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
This is called resorting to the Light.|27|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Truly, “the perfect man is the teacher of the imperfect;|27|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
But the imperfect is the stock-in-trade of the perfect man”.|27|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
He who does not respect his teacher,|27|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He who does not take care of his stock-in-trade,|27|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Much learning through he may possess, is far astray.|27|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
This is the essential secret.|27|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
“He who knows the males, yet cleaves to what is female|28|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Because like a ravine, receiving all things under heaven,”|28|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
And being such a ravine|28|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He knows all the time a power that he never calls upon in vain.|28|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
This is returning to the state of infancy.|28|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He who knows the white, (yet cleaves to the black|28|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Becomes the standard by which all things are tested;|28|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And being such a standard|28|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He has all the time a power that never errs,|28|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He returns to the Limitless.|28|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
He who knows glory,) yet cleaves to ignominy|28|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Become like a valley that receives into it all things under heaven,|28|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And being such a valley|28|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He has all the time a power that suffices;|28|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He returns to the state of the Uncarved Block.|28|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Now when a block is sawed up it is made into implements;|28|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
But when the Sage uses it, it becomes Chief of all Ministers.|28|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Truly, “The greatest carver does the least cutting”.|28|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Those that would gain what is under heaven by tampering with it -|29|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
I have seen that they do not succeed.|29|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
For that which is under heaven is like a holy vessel, dangerous to tamper with.|29|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Those that tamper with it, harm it.|29|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Those that grab at it, lose it.|29|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
For among the creatures of the world some go in front, some follow;|29|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Some blow hot when others would be blowing cold.|29|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Some are feeling vigorous just when others are worn out.|29|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Therefore the Sage “discards the absolute, the all-inclusive, the extreme”.|29|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
He who by Tao purposes to help a ruler of men|30|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Will oppose all conquest by force of arms;|30|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
For such things are wont to rebound.|30|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Where armies are, thorn and brambles grow.|30|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The raising of a great host|30|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Is followed by a year of dearth.|30|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore a good general effects his purpose and then stops; he does not take further advantage of his victory.|30|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Fulfils his purpose and does not glory in what he has done;|30|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Fulfils his purpose and does not boast of what he has done;|30|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Fulfils his purpose, but takes no pride in what he has done;|30|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Fulfils his purpose, but only as a step that could not be avoided.|30|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Fulfils his purpose, but without violence;|30|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
For what has a time of vigour also has a time of decay.|30|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
This is against Tao,|30|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And what is against Tao will soon perish.|30|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0

How difference the words that Tao gives forth!|35|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
So thin, so flavourless!|35|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
If one looks for Tao, there is nothing solid to see;|35|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
If one listens for it, there is nothing loud enough to hear.|35|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0

What is in the end to be shrunk|36|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Must first be stretched.|36|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Whatever is to be weakened|36|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Must begin by being made strong.|36|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
What is to be overthrown|36|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Must begin by being set up.|36|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He who would be a taker|36|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Must begin as a giver.|36|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
This is called “dimming” one's light.|36|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
It is thus that the soft overcomes the hard|36|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And the weak, the strong.|36|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
“It is best to leave the fish down in his pool;|36|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0

Tao never does;|37|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Yet through it all things are done.|37|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
If the barons and kings would but possess themselves of it,|37|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The ten thousand creatures would at once be transformed.|37|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And if having been transformed they should desire to act,|37|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
We must restrain them by the blankness of the Unnamed.|37|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The blankness of the Unnamed|37|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Brings dispassion;|37|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To be dispassionate is to be still.|37|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And so, of itself, the whole empire will be at rest.|37|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The man of highest “power” does not reveal himself as a possessor of “power”;|38|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Therefore he keeps his “power”.|38|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The man of inferior “power” cannot rid it of the appearance of “power”;|38|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore he is in truth without “power”.|38|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The man of highest “power” neither acts nor is there any who so regards him;|38|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The man of inferior “power” both acts and is so regarded.|38|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The man of highest humanity, though he acts, is not regarded;|38|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Whereas a man of even the highest morality both acts and is so regarded;|38|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
While even he who is best versed in ritual not merely acts,|38|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
But if people fail to respond|38|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Then he will pull up his sleeves and advance upon them.|38|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
That is why it is said:|38|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
“After Tao was lost, then came the 'power';|38|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
After the 'power' was lost, then came human kindness.”|38|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
After human kindness was lost, then came morality,|38|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
After morality was lost, then came ritual.|38|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Now ritual is the mere husk of loyalty and promise-keeping|38|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And is indeed the first step towards brawling.”|38|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Foreknowledge may be the “flower of doctrine”,|38|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
But it is the beginning of folly.|38|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore the full-grown man takes his stand upon the solid substance|38|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And not upon the mere husk,|38|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Upon the fruit and not upon the flower.|38|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0

The sky through such understanding remains limpid,|39|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0

Were it not so limpid, the sky would soon get torn,|39|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Were is not for steadiness, the earth would soon tip over,|39|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0

Were it not for this replenishment, the abyss would soon go dry,|39|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Were it not that ten thousand creatures can bear their kind,|39|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
They would soon become extinct.|39|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Were the barons and princes no longer directors of their people|39|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0

Truly “ the humble is the stem upon which the mighty grows,|39|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The low is the foundation upon which the high is laid.”|39|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0

“The Needy”, “The Ill-provided.|39|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0

While others resounded like stone chimes”.|39|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
In Tao the only motion is returning;|40|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
The only useful quality, weakness.|40|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
For though all creatures under heaven are the products of Being,|40|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Being itself is the product of Not-being.|40|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
When the man of highest capacities hears Tao|41|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He does his best to put it into practice.|41|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
When the man of middling capacity hears Tao|41|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
He is in two minds about it.|41|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
When the man of low capacity hears Tao|41|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
He laughs loudly at it.|41|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
If he did not laugh, it would not be worth the name of Tao.|41|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore the proverb has it:|41|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
“The way out into the light often looks dark,|41|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The way that goes ahead often looks as if it went back.”|41|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
The way that is least hilly often looks as if it went up and down,|41|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
The “power” that is really loftiest looks like an abyss,|41|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
What is sheerest white looks blurred.|41|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
The “power” that is most sufficing looks inadequate,|41|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The “power” that stands firmest looks flimsy.|41|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
What is in its natural, pure state looks faded;|41|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The largest square has no corners,|41|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
The greatest vessel takes the longest to finish,|41|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Great music has the faintest notes,|41|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The Great From is without shape.|41|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
For Tao is hidden and nameless.|41|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Yet Tao alone supports all things and brings them to fulfillment.|41|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Tao gave birth to the One;|42|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The One gave birth successively to two things,|42|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Three things, up to ten thousand.|42|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
These ten thousand creatures cannot turn their backs to the shade|42|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Without having the sun on their bellies,|42|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
And it is on this blending of the breaths that their harmony depends.|42|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
To be orphaned, needy, ill-provided is what men most hate;|42|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Yet princes and dukes style themselves so.|42|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Truly, “things are often increased by seeking to diminish them|42|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
And diminished by seeking to increase them.”|42|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The maxims that others use in their teaching I too will use in mine.|42|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Show me a man of violence that came to a good end,|42|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And I will take him for my teacher.|42|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
What is of all things most yielding|43|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Can overwhelm that which is of all things most hard.|43|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Being substanceless it can enter even where is no space;|43|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
That is how I know the value of action that is actionless.|43|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
But that there can be teaching without words,|43|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Value in action that is actionless,|43|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Few indeed can understand.|43|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Fame or one's own self, which matters to one most?|44|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
One's own self or things bought, which should count most?|44|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
In the getting or the losing, which is worse?|44|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Hence he who grudges expense pays dearest in the end;|44|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He who has hoarded most will suffer the heaviest loss.|44|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Be content with what you have and are, and no one can despoil you;|44|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Who stops in time nothing can harm.|44|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He is forever safe and secure.|44|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
What is most perfect seems to have something missing;|45|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Yet its use is unimpaired.|45|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
What is most full seems empty;|45|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Yet its use will never fail.|45|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
What is most straight seems crooked;|45|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
The greatest skill seems like clumsiness,|45|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
The greatest eloquence like stuttering.|45|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Movement overcomes cold;|45|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
But staying still overcomes heat.|45|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
So he by his limpid calm|45|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Puts right everything under heaven.|45|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
When there is Tao in the empire|46|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
The galloping steeds are turned back to fertilize the ground by their droppings.|46|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
When there is not Tao in the empire|46|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
War horses will be reared even on the sacred mounds below the city walls.|46|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
(No lure is greater than to possess what others want,)|46|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
No disaster greater than not to be content with what one has,|46|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
No presage of evil greater than men should be wanting to get more.|46|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Truly:|46|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
“He who has once known the contentment that comes simply through being content,|46|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Will never again be otherwise than contented”.|46|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Without leaving his door|47|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He knows everything under heaven.|47|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Without looking out of his window|47|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
He knows all the ways of heaven.|47|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
For the further one travels|47|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The less one knows.|47|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore the Sage arrives without going,|47|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Sees all without looking,|47|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Does nothing, yet achieves everything.|47|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Learning consists in adding to one's stock day by day;|48|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The practice of Tao consists in “subtracting day by day,|48|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Subtracting and yet again subtracting|48|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Till one has reached inactivity.|48|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
But by this very inactivity|48|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Everything can be activated.”|48|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Those who of old won the adherence of all who live under heaven|48|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
All did so not interfering.|48|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Had they interfered,|48|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
They would never have won this adherence.|48|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The Sage has no heart of his own;|49|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
He uses the heart of the people as his heart.|49|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Of the good man I approve,|49|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
But of the bad I also approve,|49|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
And thus he gets goodness.|49|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The truthful man I believe, but the liar I also believe,|49|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And thus he gets truthfulness.|49|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The Sage, in the dealings with the world, seems like one dazed with fright;|49|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
For the world's sake be dulls his wits.|49|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The Hundred Families all the time strain their eyes and ears,|49|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The Sage all the time sees and hears no more than an infant sees and hears.|49|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
He who aims at life achieves death.|50|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
If the “companions of life” are thirteen,|50|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
So likewise are the “companions of death” thirteen.|50|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
How is it that the “death-stops” in man's life|50|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
And activity are also thirteen?|50|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
It is because men feed life too grossly.|50|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
It is said that he who has a true hold on life,|50|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
When he walks on land does not meet tigers or wild buffaloes;|50|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
In battle he is not touched by weapons of war.|50|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Indeed,|50|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
A buffalo that attacked him would find nothing for its horns to butt,|50|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
A tiger would find nothing for its claws to tear,|50|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
A weapon would find no place for its point to enter in.|50|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
And why?|50|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Because such men have no “death-spot” in them.|50|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Tao gave them birth;|51|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
The “power” of Tao reared them,|51|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Shaped them according to their kinds,|51|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Perfected them, giving to each its strength.|51|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore|51|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Of the ten thousand things there is not one that does not worship Tao|51|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
And do homage to its “power”.|51|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
No mandate ever went forth that accorded to Tao the right to be worshipped,|51|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Nor to its “power” the right to be worshipped,|51|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Nor to its “power” the right to receive homage.|51|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
It was always and of itself so.|51|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore as Tao bore them and the “power” of Tao reared them,|51|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Made them grow, fostered them,|51|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Harboured them,|51|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Brewed for them,|51|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
So you must rear them, but not lay claim to them,|51|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Control them, but never lean upon them,|51|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Be chief among them, but not manage them.|51|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
This is called the mysterious power.”|51|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
That which was the beginning of all things under heaven|52|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
We may speak of as the “mother” of all things.|52|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He who apprehends the mother|52|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Thereby knows the sons.|52|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And he who has known the sons,|52|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Will hold all the tighter to the mother,|52|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And to the end of his days suffer no harm;|52|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
“Block the passages, shut the doors,|52|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And till the end your strength shall not fail.|52|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Open up the passages, increase your doings,|52|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And till your last day no help shall come to you.”|52|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
As good sight means seeing what is very small|52|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
So strength means holding on to what is weak.|52|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He who having used the outer-light can return to the innerlight|52|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Is thereby preserved from all harm.|52|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
This is called resorting to the always-so.|52|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
He who has the least scrap of sense,|53|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Once he has got started on the great highway has nothing to fear|53|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
So long as he avoids turnings.|53|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
For great highways are safe and easy.|53|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
But men love by-paths.|53|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
So long as Court is in order|53|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
They are content to let their fields run to weed|53|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
And their granaries stand empty.|53|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
They wear patterns and embroideries,|53|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Carry sharp swords, glut themselves with drink and food,|53|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Have more possessions than they can use.|53|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
These are the riotous ways of brigandage; they are not the Highway.|53|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
What Tao plants cannot be plucked,|54|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
What Tao clasps, cannot slip.|54|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
By its virtue alone can one generation after another carry on the ancestrial sacrifice.|54|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Apply it to yourself and by its power you will be freed from dross.|54|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Apply it to your household and your household shall thereby have abundance.|54|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Apply it to the village, and the village will be made secure.|54|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Apply it to the kingdom, and the kingdom shall thereby be made to flourish.|54|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Apply it to an empire, and the empire shall thereby be extended.|54|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore just as through oneself one may contemplate Oneself,|54|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
So through the household one may contemplate the Household,|54|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
And through the village, one may contemplate the Village,|54|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
And through the kingdom, one may contemplate the Kingdom,|54|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And through the empire, one may contemplate the Empire.|54|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
How do I know that the empire is so?|54|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
By this.|54|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The impunity of things fraught with the “power”|55|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
May be likened to that of an infant.|55|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Poisonous insects do not sting it,|55|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Nor fierce beasts seize it,|55|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Nor clawing birds maul it,|55|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Its bones are soft, its sinews weak; but its grip is strong.|55|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Not yet to have known the union of male and female,|55|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
But to be completely formed,|55|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Means that the vital force is at its height;|55|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
To be able to scream all day without getting hoarse|55|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Means that the harmony is at its perfection.|55|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To understand such harmony is to understand the always so.|55|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To understand the always-so is to be illumined.|55|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
But to fill life to the brim is to invite omens.|55|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
If the heart makes calls upon the life-breath, rigidity follows.|55|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Whatever has a time of vigour also has a time of decay.|55|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Such things are against Tao,|55|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And whatever is against Tao is soon destroyed.|55|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Those who know do not speak;|56|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Those who speak do not know.|56|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Black the passages,|56|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Shut the doors,|56|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Let all sharpness be blunted,|56|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
All tangles untied,|56|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
All glare tempered.|56|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
All dust smoothed.|56|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
This is called the mysterious leveling.|56|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
He who has achieved it cannot either be drawn into friendship or repelled,|56|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Cannot be benefited, cannot be harmed,|56|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Cannot either be raised or humbled,|56|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And for that very reason is highest of all creatures under heaven.|56|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
“Kingdoms can only be governed if rules are kept;|57|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Battles can only be won if rules are broken.”|57|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
But the adherence of all under heaven can only be won by letting-alone.|57|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
How do I know that it is so?|57|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
By this.|57|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The more prohibitions there are, the more ritual avoidances,|57|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
The poorer the people will be.|57|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The more “sharp weapons” there are,|57|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
The more benighted will the whole land grow.|57|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The more cunning craftsmen there are,|57|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
The more pernicious contrivances will be invented.|57|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The more laws are promulgated,|57|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The more thieves and bandits there will be.|57|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore a sage has said:|57|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
So long as I “do nothing” the people will of themselves be transformed.|57|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
So long as I love quietude, the people will of themselves go straight.|57|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
So long as I act only by inactivity the people will of themselves become prosperous.|57|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
So long as I have no wants|57|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The people will of themselves return to the “state of the Uncarved Block”.|57|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
When the ruler looks repressed the people will be happy and satisfied;|58|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
When the rule looks lively and self-assured the people will be carping and discontented.|58|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
“It is upon bad fortune that good fortune leans, upon good fortune that bad fortune rests.”|58|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
But though few know it, there is a bourn where there is neither right nor wrong;|58|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
In a realm where every straight is doubled by a crooked,|58|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
And every good by an ill, surely mankind has gone long enough astray?|58|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore the Sage|58|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Squares without cutting,|58|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Shapes the corners without iopping,|58|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Straightens without stretching,|58|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Gives forth light without shining.|58|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
You cannot rule men nor serve heaven unless you have laid up a store;|59|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
This “laying up a store” means quickly absorbing,|59|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And “quickly absorbing” means doubling one's garnered “power”.|59|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Double your garnered power and it acquires a strength that nothing can overcome.|59|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
If there is nothing it cannot overcome, it know no bounds,|59|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And only what knows no bounds is huge enough to keep a whole kingdom in its grasp.|59|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
But only he who having the kingdom goes to the Mother can keep it long.|59|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
This is called the art of making the roots strike deep by fencing the trunk,|59|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Of making life long by fixed staring.|59|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Ruling a large kingdom is indeed like cooking small fish.|60|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
They who by Tao all that is under heaven|60|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Did not let an evil spirit within them display its powers.|60|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Nay, it was not only that the evil spirit did not display its powers;|60|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Neither was the Sage's good spirit used to the hurt of other men.|60|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Nor was it only that his good spirit was not used to harm other men,|60|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The Sage himself was thus saved from harm.|60|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And so, each being saved from harm,|60|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Their “powers” could converge towards a common end.|60|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
A large kingdom must be like the low ground towards which all streams flows down.|61|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
It must be a point towards which all things under heaven converge.|61|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Its part must be that of the female in its dealings with all things under heaven.|61|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The female by quiescence conquers the male; by quiescence gets underneath.|61|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
If a large kingdom can in the same way succeed in getting underneath a small kingdom|61|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Then it will win the adherence of the small kingdom;|61|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And it is because small kingdoms are by nature in this way underneath large kingdoms|61|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
That they win the adherence of large kingdoms.|61|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The one must get underneath in order to do it;|61|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
The other is underneath and therefore does it.|61|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
(What large countries really need is more inhabitants;|61|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
And what small countries need is some place|61|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Where their surplus inhabitants can go and get employment.)|61|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Thus each gets what it needs.|61|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
That is why I say the large kingdom must “get underneath”.|61|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Tao in the Universe is like the south-west corner in the house.|62|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
It is the treasure of the good man,|62|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The support of the bad.|62|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
There is a traffic in speakers of fine words;|62|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Persons of grave demeanour are accepted as gifts;|62|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Even the bad let slip no opportunity to acquire them.|62|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Therefore on the day of an Emperor's enthronement|62|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Or at the installation of the three officers of State|62|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Rather than send a team of four horses, preceded by a disc of jade,|62|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Better were it, as can be done without moving from one's seat,|62|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
To send this Tao.|62|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
For what did the ancients say of this Tao,|62|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
How did they prize it?|62|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Did they not say of those that have it|62|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
“Pursuing, they shall catch; pursued, they shall escape?”|62|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
They thought it, indeed, most precious of all things under heaven.|62|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
It acts without action, does without doing,|63|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Finds flavour in what is flavourless,|63|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Can make the small great and the few many,|63|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
“Requites injuries with good deeds,|63|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Deals with the hard while it is still easy,|63|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
With the great while it is still small.”|63|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
In the governance of empire everything difficult|63|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Must be dealt with while it is still easy,|63|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Everything great must be dealt with while it is still small.|63|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore the Sage never has to deal with the great;|63|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And so achieves greatness.|63|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
But again “Light assent inspires little confidence|63|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
And 'many easies' means many a hard.”|63|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Therefore the Sage knows too how to make the easy difficult,|63|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
And by doing so avoid all difficulties!|63|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
“What stays still is easy to hold;|64|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Before there has been an omen it is easy to lay plans.|64|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
What is tender is easily torn,|64|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
What is minute is easy to scatter.”|64|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Deal with things in their state of not-yet-being,|64|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Put them in order before they have got into confusion.|64|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
For “the tree big as a man's embrace began as a tiny sprout,|64|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The tower nine storeys high began with a heap of earth,|64|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
The journey of a thousand leagues began with what was under the feet”.|64|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
He who acts, harms; he who grabs, lets slip.|64|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Therefore the Sage does not act, and so does not harm;|64|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Does not grab, and so does not let slip.|64|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Whereas the people of the world, at their tasks,|64|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Constantly spoil things when within an ace of completing them.|64|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
“Heed the end no less than the beginning,”|64|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And your work will not be spoiled.|64|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore the Sage wants only things that are unwanted,|64|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Sets no store by products difficult to get,|64|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And so teaches things untaught,|64|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Turning all men back to the things they have left behind,|64|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
That the ten thousand creatures may be restored to their Self-so.|64|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
This he does; but dare not act.|64|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
In the days of old those who practiced Tao with success did not,|65|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
By means of it,|65|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Enlighten the people, but on the contrary sought to make them ignorant.|65|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The more knowledge people have, the harder they are to rule.|65|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Those who seek to rule by giving knowledge|65|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Are like bandits preying on the land.|65|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Those who rule without giving knowledge|65|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Bring a stock of good fortune to the land.|65|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To have understood the difference between these who things|65|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Is to have a test and standard|65|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To be always able to apply this test and standard|65|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Is called the mysterious “power”, so deep-penetrating,|65|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
So far-reaching,|65|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
That can follow things back —|65|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
All the way back to the Great Concordance.|65|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
How did the great rivers and seas get their kingship|66|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Over the hundred lesser streams?|66|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Through the merit of being lower than they;|66|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
That was how they got their kingship.|66|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Therefore the Sage|66|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
In order to be above the people|66|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Must speak as though he were lower than the people.|66|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
In order to guide them|66|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He must put himself behind them.|66|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Only thus can the Sage be on top and the people not be crushed by his weight.|66|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Only thus can he guide, and the people not be led into harm|66|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Indeed in this way everything under heaven will into harm be pushed by him|66|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And will not find his guidance irk-some.|66|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
This he does by not striving;|66|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And because he does not strive, none can contend with him.|66|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Every one under heaven says that our Way is greatly like folly.|67|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
But it is just because it is great, that it seems like folly.|67|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
As for things that do not seem like folly — well,|67|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
There can be no question about their smallness!|67|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Here are my three treasures.|67|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Guard and keep them!|67|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The first is pity;|67|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The second, frugality;|67|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The third, refusal to be “foremost of all things under heaven.”|67|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
For only he that pities is truly able to be brave;|67|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Only he that is frugal is able to be profuse.|67|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Only he that refuse to be foremost of all things|67|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Is truly able to become chief of all Ministers.|67|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
At present your bravery is not based on pity,|67|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Nor your profusion on frugality,|67|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Nor your vanguard on your rear; and this is death.|67|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
But pity cannot fight without conquering or guard without.|67|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
But pity cannot fight without conquering or guard without saving.|67|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Heaven arms with pity those whom it would not see destroyed.|67|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The best charioteers do not rush ahead;|68|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The best fighters do not make displays of wrath.|68|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The greatest conqueror wins without joining issue;|68|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The best user of men acts as though he were their inferior.|68|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
This is called the power that comes of not contending,|68|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Is called the capacity to use men,|68|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
The secret of being mated to heaven, to what was of old.|68|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The strategists have the sayings:|69|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
“When you doubt your ability to meet the enemy's attack,|69|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Take the offensive yourself”|69|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And “If you doubt your ability to advance an inch, then retreat a foot”.|69|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
This latter is what we call to march without moving,|69|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
To roll the sleeve, but present no bare arm,|69|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
The hand that seems to hold, yet had no weapon in it,|69|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
A host that can confront, yet presents no battle-front.|69|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Now the greatest of all calamities is to attack and find no enemy.|69|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
I can have no enemy only at the price of losing my treasure.|69|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Therefore when armies are raised|69|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And issues joined it is he who does not delight in war that wins.|69|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
My words are very easy to understand|70|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And very easy to put into practice.|70|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Yet no one under heaven understands them;|70|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
No one puts them into practice.|70|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
But my words have an ancestry, my deeds have a lord;|70|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And it is precisely because men do not understand this|70|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
That they are unable to understand me.|70|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Few then understand me, but it is upon this very fact my value depends.|70|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
It is indeed in this sense that “the Sage wears hair-cloth on top,|70|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
But carries jade under neath his dress.”|70|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
“To know when one does not know is best.|71|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
To think one knows when one does not know is a dire disease.|71|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Only he who recognizes this disease as a disease|71|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0

The Sage's way of curing disease|71|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Also consists in making people recognize their diseases as diseases|71|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
And thus ceasing to be diseased.|71|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Never mind if the people are not intimidated by your authority.|72|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
A Mightier Authority will deal with them in the end.|72|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Do not narrow their dwelling or harass their lives;|72|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And for the very reason that you do not harass them,|72|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
They will cease to turn from you.|72|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore the Sage knows himself but does not show himself.|72|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Knows his own value, but does not put himself on high.|72|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Truly, he rejects that but takes this”.|72|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He whose braveness lies in daring, slays.|73|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He whose braveness lies in not daring , gives life.|73|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Of these two, either may be profitable or unprofitable.|73|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
But “Heaven hates what it hates;|73|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
None can know the reason why”.|73|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Wherefore the Sage, too, disallows it.|73|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
For it is the way of Heaven not to strive but none the less to conquer,|73|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Not to speak, but none the less to get an answer,|73|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Not to beckon; yet things come to it of themselves.|73|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Heaven is like one who says little, yet none the less has laid his plans.|73|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Heaven's net is wide;|73|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Coarse are the meshes, yet nothing slips through.|73|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
The people are not frightened of death.|74|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
What then is the use of trying to intimidate them with the death-penalty?|74|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And even supposing people were generally frightened of death|74|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And did not regard it as an everyday thing,|74|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Which of us would dare to seize them and slay them?|74|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
There is the Lord of Slaughter always ready for this task,|74|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And to do it in his stead is like thrusting oneself into the master-carpenter's place|74|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
And doing his chipping for him.|74|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Now “he who tries to do the master-carpenter's chipping for him is lucky if he does not cut his hand.”|74|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The people starve because those above them eat too much tax-grain.|75|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
That is the only reason why they starve.|75|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The people are difficult to keep in order because those above them interfere.|75|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
That is the only reason why they are so difficult to keep in order.|75|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The people attach no importance to death,|75|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Because those above them are too grossly absorbed in the pursuit of life.|75|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
That is why they attach no importance to death.|75|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And indeed, in that their hearts are so little set on life|75|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
They are superior to these who set store by life.|75|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
When he is born, man is soft and weak;|76|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
In death he becomes stiff and hard.|76|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The ten thousand creatures and all plants|76|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
And trees while they are alive are supple and soft,|76|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
But when and dead they become brittle and dry.|76|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Truly, what is stiff and hard is a “companion of death”;|76|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
What is soft and weak is a “companion of life”.|76|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore “the weapon that is too hard will be broken,|76|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The tree that has the hardest wood will be cut down”.|76|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Truly, the hard and mighty are cast down;|76|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The soft and weak set on high.|76|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Heaven's way is like the bending of a bow.|77|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
When a bow is bent the top comes down and the bottom-end comes up.|77|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
So too does Heaven take away from those who have too much,|77|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And give to those that have not enough.|77|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
But if it is Heaven's way to take from those who have too much|77|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And give to those who have not enough, this is far from being man's way.|77|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He takes away from those that have not-enough in order|77|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To make offering to those who already have too much.|77|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
One there is and one only, so rich that he the possessor of Tao.|77|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
(If, then, the Sage “though he controls does not lean,|77|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
And when he has achieved his aim does not linger”,|77|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
It is because he does not wish to reveal himself as better than others.)|77|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Nothing under heaven is softer or more yielding than water;|78|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
But when it attacks things hard and resistant there is not one of them that can prevail.|78|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
For they can find no way of altering it.|78|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
That the yielding conquers the resistant|78|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
And the soft conquers the hard is a fact known by all men,|78|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Yet utilized by none.|78|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Yet it is in reference to this that the Sage said|78|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0
“Only he who has accepted the dirt of the country can be lord of its soil shrines;|78|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Only he who takes upon himself the evils of the country|78|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Can become a king among those what dwell under heaven.”|78|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Straight words seem crooked.|78|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
(To requite injuries with good deeds.)|79|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To allay the main discontent,|79|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
But only in a manner that will certainly produce further discontents can hardly be called successful.|79|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore the Sage behaves like the holder of the left-hand tally,|79|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Who stays where he is and does not go round making claims on people.|79|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
For he who has the “power” of Tao is the Grand Almoner;|79|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
He who has not the “power” is the Grand Perquisitor.|79|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
“It is Heaven's way, without distinction of persons,|79|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To keep the good perpetually supplied.”|79|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Given a small country with few inhabitants,|80|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
He could bring it about that through|80|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
There should be among the people contrivances requiring ten times,|80|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
A hundred times less labour, they would not use them.|80|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He could bring it about that the people would be ready|80|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To lay down their lives and lay them down again in defence of their homes,|80|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Tather than emigrate.|80|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
There might still be boats and carriage,|80|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
But no one would go in them;|80|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
There might still be weapons of war,|80|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
But no one would drill with them.|80|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
He could bring it about that|80|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
“The people should have no use for any from of writing save knotted ropes,|80|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0

That one could one could hear the cocks crowing in it, the dogs barking;|80|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
But the people would grow old and die without ever having been there”.|80|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
True words are not fine-sounding;|81|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Fine-sounding words are not true.|81|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The good man does not prove by argument;|81|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The he who proves by argument is not good.|81|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
True wisdom is different from much learning;|81|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Much learning means little wisdom.|81|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The Sage has no need to hoard;|81|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
When his own last scrap has been used up on behalf of others,|81|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Lo, he has more than before!|81|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
When his own last scrap has been used up in giving to other,|81|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Lo, his stock is even greater than before!|81|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
For heaven's way is to sharpen without cutting,|81|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
