Text|Chapter
The Tao the can be told of|1
Is not the Absolute Tao;|1
The Names that can be given|1
Are not Absolute Names.|1
The Nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth;|1
The Named is the Mother of All Things.|1
Therefore:|1
Oftentimes, one strips oneself of passion|1
In order to see the Secret of Life;|1
Oftentimes, one regards life with passion,|1
In order to see its manifest forms.|1
These two (the Secret and its manifestations)|1
Are (in their nature) the same;|1
They are given different names|1
When they become manifest.|1
They may both be called the Cosmic Mystery:|1
Reaching from the Mystery into the Deeper Mystery|1
Is the Gate to the Secret of All Life.|1
When the people of the Earth all know beauty as beauty,|2
There arises (the recognition of) ugliness.|2
When the people of the Earth all know the good as good,|2
There arises (the recognition of) evil.|2
Therefore:|2
Being and non-being interdepend in growth;|2
Difficult and easy interdepend in completion;|2
Long and short interdepend in contrast;|2
High and low interdepend in position;|2
Tones and voice interdepend in harmony;|2
Front and behind interdepend in company.|2
Therefore the Sage:|2
Manages affairs without action;|2
Preaches the doctrine without words;|2
All things take their rise, but he does not turn away from them;|2
He gives them life, but does not take possession of them;|2
He acts, but does not appropriate;|2
Accomplishes, but claims no credit.|2
It is because he lays claim to no credit|2
That the credit cannot be taken away from him.|2
Exalt not the wise,|3
So that the people shall not scheme and contend;|3
Prize not rare objects,|3
So that the people shall not steal;|3
Shut out from site the things of desire,|3
So that the people's hearts shall not be disturbed.|3
Therefore in the government of the Sage:|3
He keeps empty their hearts|3
Makes full their bellies,|3
Discourages their ambitions,|3
Strengthens their frames;|3
So that the people may be innocent of knowledge and desires.|3
And the cunning ones shall not presume to interfere.|3
By action without deeds|3
May all live in peace.|3
Tao is a hollow vessel,|4
And its use is inexhaustible!|4
Fathomless!|4
Like the fountain head of all things,|4
Its sharp edges rounded off,|4
Its tangles untied,|4
Its light tempered,|4
Its turmoil submerged,|4
Yet dark like deep water it seems to remain.|4
I do not know whose Son it it,|4
An image of what existed before God.|4
Nature is unkind:|5
It treats the creation like sacrificial straw-dogs.|5
The Sage is unkind:|5
He treats the people like sacrificial straw-dogs.|5
How the universe is like a bellows!|5
Empty, yet it gives a supply that never fails;|5
The more it is worked, the more it brings forth.|5
By many words is wit exhausted.|5
Rather, therefore, hold to the core.|5
The Spirit of the Valley never dies.|6
It is called the Mystic Female.|6
The Door of the Mystic Female|6
Is the root of Heaven and Earth.|6
Continuously, continuously,|6
It seems to remain.|6
Draw upon it|6
And it serves you with ease.|6
The universe is everlasting.|7
The reason the universe is everlasting|7
Is that it does not life for Self.|7
Therefore it can long endure.|7
Therefore the Sage puts himself last,|7
And finds himself in the foremost place;|7
Regards his body as accidental,|7
And his body is thereby preserved.|7
Is it not because he does not live for Self|7
That his Self is realized?|7
The best of men is like water;|8
Water benefits all things|8
And does not compete with them.|8
It dwells in (the lowly) places that all disdain -|8
Wherein it comes near to the Tao.|8
In his dwelling, (the Sage) loves the (lowly) earth;|8
In his heart, he loves what is profound;|8
In his relations with others, he loves kindness;|8
In his words, he loves sincerity;|8
In government, he loves peace;|8
In business affairs, he loves ability;|8
In hi actions, he loves choosing the right time.|8
It is because he does not contend|8
That he is without reproach.|8
Stretch (a bow) to the very full,|9
And you will wish you had stopped in time.|9
Temper a (sword-edge) to its very sharpest,|9
And the edge will not last long.|9
When gold and jade fill your hall,|9
You will not be able to keep them safe.|9
To be proud with wealth and honor|9
Is to sow seeds of one's own downfall.|9
Retire when your work is done,|9
Such is Heaven's way.|9
In embracing the One with your soul,|10
Can you never forsake the Tao?|10
In controlling your vital force to achieve gentleness,|10
Can you become like the new-born child?|10
In cleansing and purifying your Mystic vision,|10
Can you strive after perfection?|10
In loving the people and governing the kingdom,|10
Can you rule without interference?|10
In opening and shutting the Gate of Heaven,|10
Can you play the part of the Female?|10
In comprehending all knowledge,|10
Can you renounce the mind?|10
Thirty spokes unite around the nave;|11
From their not-being (loss of their individuality)|11
Arises the utility of the wheel.|11
Mold clay into a vessel;|11
From its not-being (in the vessel's hollow)|11
Arises the utility of the vessel.|11
Cut out doors and windows in the house (-wall),|11
From their not-being (empty space) arises the utility of the house.|11
Therefore by the existence of things we profit.|11
And by the non-existence of things we are served.|11
The five colors blind the eyes of man;|12
The five musical notes deafen the ears of man;|12
The five flavors dull the taste of man;|12
Horse-racing, hunting and chasing madden the minds of man;|12
Rare, valuable goods keep their owners awake at night.|12
Therefore the Sage:|12
Provides for the belly and not the eye.|12
Hence, he rejects the one and accepts the other.|12
"Favor and disgrace cause one dismay;|13
What we value and what we fear are within our Self."|13
What does this mean:|13
"Favor and disgrace cause one dismay?"|13
Those who receive a favor from above|13
Are dismayed when they receive it,|13
And dismayed when they lose it.|13
What does this mean:|13
"What we value and what we fear are within our Self?"|13
We have fears because we have a self.|13
When we do not regard that self as self,|13
What have we to fear?|13
Therefore he who values the world as his self|13
May then be entrusted with the government of the world;|13
And he who loves the world as his self -|13
The world may then be entrusted to his care.|13
Looked at, but cannot be seen -|14
That is called the Invisible (yi).|14
Listened to, but cannot be heard -|14
That is called the Inaudible (hsi).|14
Grasped at, but cannot be touched -|14
That is called the Intangible (wei).|14
These three elude our inquiries|14
And hence blend and become One.|14
Not by its rising, is there light,|14
Nor by its sinking, is there darkness.|14
Unceasing, continuous,|14
It cannot be defined,|14
And reverts again to the realm of nothingness.|14
That is why it is called the Form of the Formless,|14
The Image of Nothingness.|14
That is why it is called the Elusive:|14
Meet it and you do not see its face;|14
Follow it and you do not see its back.|14
The wise ones of old had subtle wisdom and depth of understanding,|15
So profound that they could not be understood.|15
And because they could not be understood,|15
Perforce must they be so described:|15
Cautious, like crossing a wintry stream,|15
Irresolute, like one fearing danger all around,|15
Grave, like one acting as guest,|15
Self-effacing, like ice beginning to melt,|15
Genuine, like a piece of undressed wood,|15
Open-minded, like a valley,|15
And mixing freely, like murky water.|15
Who can find repose in a muddy world?|15
By lying still, it becomes clear.|15
Who can maintain his calm for long?|15
By activity, it comes back to life.|15
He who embraces this Tao|15
Guards against being over-full.|15
Because he guards against being over-full,|15
He is beyond wearing out and renewal.|15
Attain the utmost in Passivity,|16
Hold firm to the basis of Quietude.|16
The myriad things take shape and rise to activity,|16
But I watch them fall back to their repose.|16
Like vegetation that luxuriantly grows|16
But returns to the root (soil) from which it springs.|16
To return to the root is Repose;|16
It is called going back to one's Destiny.|16
Going back to one's Destiny is to find the Eternal Law.|16
To know the Eternal Law is Enlightenment.|16
And not to know the Eternal Law|16
Is to court disaster.|16
He who knows the Eternal Law is tolerant;|16
Being tolerant, he is impartial;|16
Being impartial, he is kingly;|16
Being kingly, he is in accord with Nature;|16
Being in accord with Nature, he is in accord with Tao;|16
Being in accord with Tao, he is eternal,|16
And his whole life is preserved from harm.|16
Of the best rulers|17
The people (only) know that they exist;|17
The next best the love and praise;|17
The next they fear;|17
And the next they revile.|17
When they do not command the people's faith,|17
Some will lose faith in them,|17
And then they resort to oaths!|17
But (of the best) when their task is accomplished,|17
their work done,|17
The people all remark, "We have done it ourselves."|17
On the decline of the great Tao,|18
The doctrine of "humanity" and "justice" arose.|18
When knowledge and cleverness appeared,|18
Great hypocrisy followed in its wake.|18
When the six relationships no longer lived at peace,|18
There was (praise of) "kind parents" and "filial sons."|18
When a country fell into chaos and misrule,|18
There was (praise of) "loyal ministers."|18
Banish wisdom, discard knowledge,|19
And the people shall profit a hundredfold;|19
Banish "humanity," discard "justice,"|19
And the people shall recover love of their kin;|19
Banish cunning, discard "utility,"|19
And the thieves and brigands shall disappear.|19
As these three touch the externals and are inadequate,|19
The people have need of what they can depend upon:|19
Reveal thy simple self,|19
Embrace thy original nature,|19
Check thy selfishness,|19
Curtail thy desires.|19
Banish learning, and vexations end.|20
Between "Ah!" and "Ough!"|20
How much difference is there?|20
Between "good" and "evil"|20
How much difference is there?"|20
That which men fear|20
Is indeed to be feared;|20
But, alas, distant yet is the dawn (of awakening)!|20
The people of the world are merry-making,|20
As if partaking of the sacrificial feasts,|20
As if mounting the terrace in spring;|20
I alone am mild, like one unemployed,|20
Like a new-born babe that cannot yet smile,|20
Unattached, like one without a home.|20
The people of the world have enough and to spare,|20
But I am like one left out,|20
My heart must be that of a fool,|20
Being muddled, nebulous!|20
The vulgar are knowing, luminous;|20
I alone am dull, confused.|20
The vulgar are clever, self-assured;|20
I alone, depressed.|20
Patient as the sea,|20
Adrift, seemingly aimless.|20
The people of the world all have a purpose;|20
I alone appear stubborn and uncouth.|20
I alone differ from the other people,|20
And value drawing sustenance from the Mother.|20
The marks of great Character|21
Follow alone from the Tao.|21
The thing that is called Tao|21
Is elusive, evasive.|21
Evasive, elusive,|21
Yet latent in it are forms.|21
Elusive, evasive,|21
Yet latent in it are objects.|21
Dark and dim,|21
Yet latent in it is the life-force.|21
The life-force being very true,|21
Latent in it are evidences.|21
From the days of old till now|21
Its Named (manifested forms) have never ceased,|21
By which we may view the Father of All Things.|21
How do I know the shape of the Father of All Things?|21
Through these (manifested forms)!|21
To yield is to be preserved whole.|22
To be bent is to become straight.|22
To be hollow is to be filled.|22
To be tattered is to be renewed.|22
To be in want is to possess.|22
To have plenty is to be confused.|22
Therefore the Sage embraces the One,|22
And becomes the model of the world.|22
He does not reveal himself,|22
And is therefore luminous.|22
He does not justify himself,|22
And is therefore far-famed.|22
He does not boast of himself,|22
And therefore people give him credit.|22
He does not pride himself,|22
And is therefore the chief among men.|22
Is it not indeed true, as the ancients say,|22
"To yield is to be preserved whole?"|22
Thus he is preserved and the world does him homage.|22
Nature says few words:|23
Hence it is that a squall lasts not a whole morning.|23
A rainstorm continues not a whole day.|23
Where do they come from?|23
From Nature.|23
Even Nature does not last long (in its utterances),|23
How much less should human beings?|23
Therefore it is that:|23
He who follows the Tao is identified with the Tao.|23
He who follows Character (Teh) is identified with Character.|23
He who abandons (Tao) is identified with abandonment (of Tao).|23
He who is identified with Tao -|23
Tao is also glad to welcome him.|23
He who is identified with character -|23
Character is also glad to welcome him.|23
He who is identified with abandonment -|23
Abandonment is also glad t welcome him.|23
He who has not enough faith|23
Will not be able to command faith from others.|23
He who stands on tiptoe does not stand (firm);|24
He who strains his strides does not walk (well);|24
He who reveals himself is not luminous;|24
He who justifies himself is not far-famed;|24
He who boasts of himself is not given credit;|24
He who prides himself is not chief among men.|24
These in the eyes of Tao|24
Are called "the dregs and tumors of Virtue,"|24
Which are things of disgust.|24
Therefore the man of Tao spurns them.|24
Before the Heaven and Earth existed|25
There was something nebulous:|25
Silent, isolated,|25
Standing alone, changing not,|25
Eternally revolving without fail,|25
Worthy to be the Mother of All Things.|25
I do not know its name|25
And address it as Tao.|25
If forced to give it a name, I shall call it "Great."|25
Being great implies reaching out in space,|25
Reaching out in space implies far-reaching,|25
Far-reaching implies reversion to the original point.|25
Therefore:|25
Tao is Great,|25
The Heaven is great,|25
The Earth is great,|25
The King is also great.|25
There are the Great Four in the universe,|25
And the King is one of them.|25
Man models himself after the Earth;|25
The Earth models itself after Heaven;|25
The Heaven models itself after Tao;|25
Tao models itself after nature.|25
The Solid is the root of the light;|26
The Quiescent is the master of the Hasty.|26
Therefore the Sage travels all day|26
Yet never leaves his provision-cart.|26
In the midst of honor and glory,|26
He lives leisurely, undisturbed.|26
How can the ruler of a great country|26
Make light of his body in the empire (by rushing about)?|26
In light frivolity, the Center is lost;|26
In hasty action, self-mastery is lost.|26
A good runner leaves no track.|27
A good speech leaves no flaws for attack.|27
A good reckoner makes use of no counters.|27
A well-shut door makes use of no bolts,|27
And yet cannot be opened.|27
A well-tied knot makes use of no rope,|27
And yet cannot be untied.|27
Therefore the Sage is good at helping men;|27
For that reason there is no rejected (useless) person.|27
He is good at saving things;|27
For that reason there is nothing rejected.|27
- This is called stealing the Light.|27
Therefore the good man is the Teacher of the bad.|27
And the bad man is the lesson of the good.|27
He who neither values his teacher|27
Nor loves the lesson|27
Is one gone far astray,|27
Though he be learned.|27
- Such is the subtle secret.|27
He who is aware of the Male|28
But keeps to the Female|28
Becomes the ravine of the world.|28
Being the ravine of the world,|28
He has the original character (teh) which is not cut up.|28
And returns again to the (innocence of the) babe.|28
He who is conscious of the white (bright)|28
But keeps to the black (dark)|28
Becomes the model for the world.|28
Being the model for the world,|28
He has the eternal power which never errs,|28
And returns again to the Primordial Nothingness.|28
He who is familiar with honor and glory|28
But keeps to obscurity|28
Becomes the valley of the world.|28
Being the valley of the world,|28
He has an eternal power which always suffices,|28
And returns again to the natural integrity of uncarved wood.|28
Break up this uncarved wood|28
And it is shaped into vessel|28
In the hands of the Sage|28
They become the officials and magistrates.|28
Therefore the great ruler does not cut up.|28
There are those who will conquer the world|29
And make of it (what they conceive or desire).|29
I see that they will not succeed.|29
(For) the world is God's own Vessel|29
It cannot be made (by human interference).|29
He who makes it spoils it.|29
He who holds it loses it.|29
For:  Some things go forward,|29
Some things follow behind;|29
some blow hot,|29
And some blow cold;|29
Some are strong,|29
And some are weak;|29
Some may break,|29
And some may fall.|29
Hence the Sage eschews excess, eschews extravagance,|29
Eschews pride.|29
He who by Tao purposes to help the ruler of men|30
Will oppose all conquest by force of arms.|30
For such things are wont to rebound.|30
Where armies are, thorns and brambles grow.|30
The raising of a great host|30
Is followed by a year of dearth.|30
Therefore a good general effects his purpose and stops.|30
He dares not rely upon the strength of arms;|30
Effects his purpose and does not glory in it;|30
Effects his purpose and does not boast of it;|30
Effects his purpose and does not take pride in it;|30
Effects his purpose as a regrettable necessity;|30
Effects his purpose but does not love violence.|30
(For) things age after reaching their prime.|30
That (violence) would be against the Tao.|30
And he who is against the Tao perishes young.|30
Of all things, soldiers are instruments of evil,|31
Hated by men.|31
Therefore the religious man (possessed of Tao) avoids them.|31
The gentleman favors the left in civilian life,|31
But on military occasions favors the right.|31
Soldiers are weapons of evil.|31
They are not the weapons of the gentleman.|31
When the use of soldiers cannot be helped,|31
The best policy is calm restraint.|31
Even in victory, there is no beauty,|31
And who calls it beautiful|31
Is one who delights in slaughter.|31
He who delights in slaughter|31
Will not succeed in his ambition to rule the world.|31
[The things of good omen favor the left.|31
The things of ill omen favor the right.|31
The lieutenant-general stands on the left,|31
The general stands on the right.|31
That is to say, it is celebrated as a Funeral Rite.]|31
The slaying of multitudes should be mourned with sorrow.|31
A victory should be celebrated with the Funeral Rite.|31
Tao is absolute and has no name.|32
Though the uncarved wood is small,|32
It cannot be employed (used as vessel) by anyone.|32
If kings and barons can keep (this unspoiled nature),|32
The whole world shall yield them lordship of their own accord.|32
The Heaven and Earth join,|32
And the sweet rain falls,|32
Beyond the command of men,|32
Yet evenly upon all.|32
Then human civilization arose and there were names.|32
Since there were names,|32
It were well one knew where to stop.|32
He who knows where to stop|32
May be exempt from danger.|32
Tao in the world|32
May be compared to rivers that run into the sea.|32
He who knows others is learned;|33
He who knows himself is wide.|33
He who conquers others has power of muscles;|33
He who conquers himself is strong.|33
He who is contented is rich.|33
He who id determined has strength of will.|33
He who does not lose his center endures.|33
He who dies yet (his power) remains has long life.|33
The Great Tao flows everywhere,|34
(Like a flood) it may go left or right.|34
The myriad things derive their life from it,|34
And it does not deny them.|34
When its work is accomplished,|34
It does not take possession.|34
It clothes and feeds the myriad things,|34
Yet does not claim them as its own.|34
Often (regarded) without mind or passion,|34
It may be considered small.|34
Being the home of all things, yet claiming not,|34
It may be considered great.|34
Because to the end it does not claim greatness,|34
Its greatness is achieved.|34
Hold the Great Symbol|35
and all the world follows,|35
Follows without meeting harm,|35
(And lives in) health, peace, commonwealth.|35
Offer good things to eat|35
And the wayfarer stays.|35
But Tao is mild to the taste.|35
Looked at, it cannot be seen;|35
Listened to, it cannot be heard;|35
Applied, its supply never fails.|35
He who is to be made to dwindle (in power)|36
Must first be caused to expand.|36
He who is to be weakened|36
Must first be made strong.|36
He who is to be laid low|36
Must first be exalted to power.|36
He who is to be taken away from|36
Must first be given,|36
- This is the Subtle Light.|36
Gentleness overcomes strength:|36
Fish should be left in the deep pool,|36
And sharp weapons of the state should be left|36
Where none can see them.|36
The Tao never does,|37
Yet through it everything is done.|37
If princes and dukes can keep the Tao,|37
the world will of its own accord be reformed.|37
When reformed and rising to action,|37
Let it be restrained by the Nameless pristine simplicity.|37
The Nameless pristine simplicity|37
Is stripped of desire (for contention).|37
By stripping of desire quiescence is achieved,|37
And the world arrives at peace of its own accord.|37
Book 2. The application of Dao|37
The man of superior character is not (conscious of his) character.|38
Hence he has character.|38
The man of inferior character (is intent on) not losing character.|38
Hence he is devoid of character.|38
The man of superior character never acts,|38
Nor ever (does so) with an ulterior motive.|38
The man of inferior character acts,|38
And (does so) with an ulterior motive.|38
The man of superior kindness acts,|38
But (does so) without an ulterior motive.|38
The man of superior justice acts,|38
And (does so) with an ulterior motive.|38
(But when) the man of superior li acts and finds no response,|38
He rolls up his sleeves to force it on others.|38
Therefore:|38
After Tao is lost, then (arises the doctrine of) humanity.|38
After humanity is lost, then (arises the doctrine of) justice.|38
After justice is lost, then (arises the doctrine of) li.|38
Now li is the thinning out of loyalty and honesty of heart.|38
And the beginning of chaos.|38
The prophets are the flowering of Tao|38
And the origin of folly.|38
Therefore the noble man dwells in the heavy (base),|38
And not in the thinning (end).|38
He dwells in the fruit,|38
And not in the flowering (expression).|38
Therefore he rejects the one and accepts the other.|38
There were those in ancient times possessed of the One;|39
Through possession of the One, the Heaven was clarified,|39
Through possession of the One, The Earth was stabilized,|39
Through possession of the One, the gods were spiritualized,|39
Through possession of the One, the valleys were made full,|39
Through possession of the One, all things lived and grew,|39
Through possession of the One, the princes and dukes|39
became the ennobled of the people.|39
- that was how each became so.|39
Without clarity, the Heavens would shake,|39
Without stability, the Earth would quake,|39
Without spiritual power, the gods would crumble,|39
Without being filled, the valleys would crack,|39
Without the life-giving power, all things would perish,|39
Without the ennobling power, the princes and dukes would stumble.|39
therefore the nobility depend upon the common man for support,|39
And the exalted ones depend upon the lowly for their base.|39
That is why the princes and dukes call themselves|39
"the orphaned," "the lonely one," "the unworthy."|39
Is is not true then that they depend upon the common man for support?|39
Truly, take down the parts of a chariot,|39
And there is no chariot (left).|39
Rather than jingle like the jade,|39
Rumble like the rocks.|39
Reversion is the action of Tao.|40
Gentleness is the function of Tao.|40
The things of this world come from Being,|40
And Being (comes) from Non-being.|40
When the highest type of men hear the Tao (truth),|41
they try hard to live in accordance with it.|41
When the mediocre type hear the Tao,|41
they seem to be aware and yet unaware of it.|41
When the lowest type hear the Tao,|41
They break into loud laughter -|41
If it were not laughed at, it would not be Tao.|41
Therefore there is the established saying:|41
"Who understands Tao seems dull of comprehension;|41
Who is advance in Tao seems to slip backwards;|41
Who moves on the even Tao (Path) seems to go up and down."|41
Superior character appears like a hollow (valley);|41
Sheer white appears like tarnished;|41
Great character appears like infirm;|41
Pure worth appears like contaminated.|41
Great space has no corners;|41
Great talent takes long to mature;|41
Great music is faintly heard;|41
Great form has no contour;|41
And Tao is hidden without a name.|41
It is this Tao that is adept at lending (its power)|41
and bringing fulfillment.|41
Out of Tao, One is born;|42
Out of One, Two;|42
Out of Two, Three;|42
Out of Three, the created universe.|42
The created universe carries the yin at its back|42
and the yang in front;|42
Through the union of the pervading principles it|42
reaches harmony.|42
To be "orphaned," "lonely" and "unworthy" is what men hate most.|42
Yet the princes and dukes call themselves by such names.|42
For sometimes things are benefited by being taken away from,|42
And suffer by being added to.|42
Others have taught this maxim,|42
Which I shall teach also:|42
"The violent man shall die a violent death."|42
This I shall regard as my spiritual teacher.|42
The softest substance of the world|43
Goes through the hardest.|43
That-which-is-without-form penetrates that-which-has-no-crevice;|43
Through this I know the benefit of taking no action.|43
The teaching without words|43
And the benefit of taking no action|43
Are without compare in the universe.|43
Fame or one's own self, which does one love more?|44
One's own self or material goods, which has more worth?|44
Loss (of self) or possession (of goods), which is the greater evil?|44
Therefore: he who loves most spends most,|44
He who hoards much loses much.|44
The contented man meets no disgrace;|44
Who know when to stop runs into no danger -|44
He can long endure.|44
The highest perfection is like imperfection,|45
And its use is never impaired.|45
The greatest abundance seems meager,|45
And its use will never fail.|45
What s most straight appears devious,|45
The greatest skill appears clumsiness;|45
The greatest eloquence seems like stuttering.|45
Movement overcomes cold,|45
(But) keeping still overcomes heat.|45
Who is calm and quiet becomes the guide for the universe.|45
When the world lives in accord with Tao,|46
Racing horses are turned back to haul refuse carts.|46
When the world lives not in accord with Tao,|46
Cavalry abounds in the countryside.|46
There is no greater curse than the lack of contentment.|46
No greater sin than the desire for possession.|46
Therefore he who is contented with contentment|46
shall be always content.|46
Without stepping outside one's doors,|47
One can know what is happening in the world,|47
Without looking out of one's windows,|47
One can see the Tao of heaven.|47
The farther one pursues knowledge,|47
The less one knows.|47
Therefore the Sage knows without running about,|47
Understands without seeing,|47
Accomplishes without doing.|47
The student of knowledge (aims at) learning day by day;|48
The student of Tao (aims at) losing day by day.|48
By continual losing|48
One reaches doing nothing (laissez-faire).|48
He who conquers the world often does so by doing nothing.|48
When one is compelled to do something,|48
The world is already beyond his conquering.|48
The Sage has no decided opinions and feelings,|49
But regards the people's opinions and feelings as his own.|49
The good ones I declare good;|49
The bad ones I also declare good.|49
That is the goodness of Virtue.|49
The honest ones I believe;|49
The liars I also believe;|49
That is the faith of Virtue.|49
The Sage dwells in the world peacefully, harmoniously.|49
The people of the world are brought into a community of heart,|49
And the Sage regards them all as his own children.|49
Out of life, death enters.|50
The companions (organs) of life are thirteen;|50
The companions (organs) of death are (also) thirteen.|50
What send man to death in this life are also (these) thirteen.|50
How is it so?|50
Because of the intense activity of multiplying life.|50
It has been said that the who is a good preserver of hi life|50
Meets no tigers or wild buffaloes on land,|50
Is not vulnerable to weapons in the field of battle.|50
The horns of the wild buffalo are powerless against him.|50
How is it so?|50
Because he is beyond death.|50
Tao gives them birth,|51
Teh (character) fosters them.|51
The material world gives them form.|51
The circumstances of the moment complete them.|51
Therefore all things of the universe worship Tao and exalt Teh.|51
Tao is worshipped and Teh is exalted|51
Without anyone's order but is so of its own accord.|51
Therefore Tao gives them birth,|51
Teh fosters them,|51
Makes them grow, develops them,|51
Gives them a harbor, a place to dwell in peace,|51
Feeds them and shelter them.|51
It gives them birth and does not own them,|51
Acts (helps) and does not appropriate them,|51
Is superior, and does not control them.|51
- This is the Mystic Virtue.|51
There was a beginning of the universe|52
Which may be regarded as the Mother of the Universe.|52
From the Mother, we may know her sons.|52
After knowing the sons, keep to the Mother.|52
Thus one's whole life may be preserved from harm.|52
Stop its apertures,|52
Close its doors,|52
And one's whole life is without toil.|52
Open its apertures,|52
Be busy about its affairs,|52
And one's whole life is beyond redemption.|52
He who can see the small is clear-sighted;|52
He who stays by gentility is strong.|52
use the light,|52
And return to clear-sightedness -|52
Thus cause not yourself later distress.|52
- This is to rest in the Absolute.|52
If I were possessed of Austere Knowledge,|53
Walking on the Main Path (Tao),|53
I would avoid the by-paths.|53
the Main path is easy to walk on,|53
Yet people love the small by-paths.|53
The (official) courts are spic and span,|53
(While) the fields go untilled,|53
And the (people's) granaries are very low.|53
(Yet) clad in embroidered gowns,|53
And carrying find swords,|53
Surfeited with good food and drinks,|53
(They are) splitting with wealth and possessions.|53
- This is to lead the world toward brigandage.|53
Is this not corruption of Tao?|53
Who is firmly established is not easily shaken.|54
Who has a firm grasp does not easily let go.|54
From generation to generation his ancestral sacrifices|54
Shall be continued without fail.|54
Cultivated in the individual, character will become genuine;|54
Cultivated in the family, character will become abundant;|54
Cultivated in the village, character will multiply;|54
Cultivated in the state, character will prosper;|54
Cultivated in the world, character will become universal.|54
Therefore:|54
According to (the character of ) the individual,|54
judge the individual;|54
According to (the character of ) the family,|54
judge the family;|54
According to (the character of ) the village,|54
judge the village;|54
According to (the character of ) the state,|54
judge the state;|54
According to (the character of ) the world,|54
judge the world.|54
How do I know this is so?|54
By this.|54
Who is rich in character|55
Is like a child.|55
No poisonous insects sting him,|55
No wild beasts attack him,|55
And no birds of prey pounce upon him.|55
His bones are soft, his sinews tender, yet his grip is strong.|55
Not knowing the union of male and female, yet his organs are complete,|55
Which means his vigor is unspoiled.|55
Crying the whole day, yet his voice never runs hoarse,|55
Which means his (natural) harmony is perfect.|55
To know harmony is to be in accord with the eternal,|55
(And) to know eternity is called discerning.|55
(But) to improve upon life is called an ill-omen;|55
To let go the emotions through impulse is called assertiveness.|55
(For) things age after reaching their prime;|55
That (assertiveness) would be against Tao.|55
And he who is against Tao perishes young.|55
He who knows does not speak;|56
He who speaks does not know.|56
Fill up its apertures,|56
Close its doors,|56
Dull its edges,|56
Untie its tangles,|56
Soften its light,|56
Submerge its turmoil,|56
- This is the Mystic Unity.|56
Then love and hatred cannot touch him.|56
Profit and loss cannot reach him.|56
Honor and disgrace cannot affect him.|56
Therefore is he always the honored one of the world.|56
Rule a kingdom by the Normal.|57
Fight a battle by (abnormal) tactics of surprise.|57
Win the world by doing nothing.|57
How do I know it is so?|57
Through this: -|57
The more prohibitions there are,|57
The poorer the people become.|57
The more sharp weapons there are,|57
The greater the chaos in the state.|57
The more skills of technique,|57
The more cunning things are produced.|57
The greater the number of statutes,|57
The greater the number of thieves and brigands.|57
Therefore the sage says:|57
I do nothing and the people are reformed of themselves.|57
I love quietude and the people are righteous of themselves.|57
I deal in no business and the people grow rich by themselves.|57
I have no desires and the people are simple|57
and honest by themselves.|57
When the government is lazy and dull,|58
Its people are unspoiled;|58
When the government is efficient and smart,|58
Its people are discontented.|58
Disaster is the avenue of fortune,|58
(And) fortune is the concealment for disaster.|58
Who would be able to know its ultimate results?|58
(As it is), there would never be the normal.|58
But the normal would (immediately) revert to the deceitful.|58
And the good revert to the sinister.|58
Thus long has mankind gone astray!|58
Therefore the Sage is square (has firm principles),|58
but not cutting (sharp-cornered),|58
Has integrity but does not hurt (others),|58
Is straight, but not high-handed,|58
Bright, but not dazzling.|58
In managing human affairs, there is no better rule|59
than to be sparing.|59
To be sparing is to forestall;|59
To forestall is to be prepared and strengthened;|59
To be prepared and strengthened is to be ever-victorious;|59
To be ever-victorious is to have infinite capacity;|59
He who has infinite capacity is fit to rule a country,|59
And the Mother (principle) of a ruling country can long endure.|59
This is to be firmly rooted, to have deep strength,|59
The road to immortality and enduring vision.|59
Rule a big country as you would fry small fish.|60
Who rules the world in accord with Tao|60
Shall find that the spirits lose their power.|60
It is not that the spirits lose their power,|60
But that they cease to do people harm.|60
It is not (only) that they cease to do people harm,|60
The Sage (himself) also does no harm to the people.|60
When both do not do each other harm,|60
The original character is restored.|60
A big country (should be like) the delta low-regions,|61
Being the concourse of the world,|61
(And) the Female of the world.|61
The Female overcomes the Male by quietude,|61
And achieves the lowly position by quietude.|61
Therefore if a big country places itself below a small country|61
It absorbs the small country.|61
(And) if a small country places itself below a big country,|61
It absorbs the big country.|61
Therefore some place themselves low to absorb (others),|61
Some are (naturally) low and absorb (others).|61
What a big country wants is but to shelter others,|61
And what a small country wants is but to be able to|61
come in and be sheltered.|61
Thus (considering) that both may have what they want,|61
A big country ought to place itself low.|61
Tao is the mysterious secret of the universe,|62
The good man's treasure,|62
And the bad man's refuge.|62
Beautiful saying can be sold at the market,|62
Noble conduct can be presented as a gift.|62
Though there be bad people,|62
Why reject them?|62
Therefore on the crowning of an emperor,|62
On the appointment of the Three Ministers,|62
Rather than send tributes of jade and teams of four horses,|62
Send in the tribute of Tao.|62
Wherein did the ancients prize this Tao?|62
Did they not say, "to search for the guilty ones and pardon them"?|62
Therefore is (tao) the treasure of the world.|62
Accomplish do-nothing.|63
Attend to no-affairs.|63
Taste the flavorless.|63
Whether it is big or small, many or few,|63
Requite hatred with virtue.|63
Deal with the difficult while yet it is easy;|63
Deal wit the big while yet it is small.|63
The difficult (problems) of the world|63
Must be dealt with while they are yet easy;|63
The great (problems) of the world|63
Must be dealt with while they are yet small.|63
Therefore the Sage by never dealing with great (problems)|63
Accomplishes greatness.|63
He who lightly makes a promise|63
Will find it often hard to keep his faith.|63
He who makes light of many things|63
Will encounter many difficulties.|63
Hence even the Sage regards things as difficult,|63
And for that reason never meets with difficulties.|63
That which lies still is easy to hold;|64
That which is not yet manifest is easy to forestall;|64
That which is brittle (like ice) easily melts;|64
That which is minute easily scatters.|64
Deal with a thing before it is there;|64
Check disorder before it is rife.|64
A tree with a full span's girth begins from a tiny sprout;|64
A nine-storied terrace begins with a clod of earth.|64
A journey of a thousand li beings at one's feet.|64
He who acts, spoils;|64
He who grasps, lets slip.|64
Because the Sage does not act, he does not spoil,|64
Because he does not grasp, he does not let slip.|64
The affairs of men are often spoiled within an ace of completion.|64
By being careful at the end as at the beginning|64
Failure is averted.|64
Therefore the Sage desires to have no desire,|64
And values not objects difficult to obtain.|64
Learns that which is unlearned,|64
And restores what the multitude have lost.|64
That he may assist in the course of Nature|64
And not presume to interfere.|64
The ancients who knew how to follow the Tao|65
Aimed not to enlighten the people.,|65
But to keep them ignorant.|65
The reason it is difficult for the people to leave in peace|65
Is because of too much knowledge.|65
Those who seek to rule a country by knowledge|65
Are the nation's curse.|65
Those who seek not to rule a country by knowledge|65
Are the nation's blessing.|65
Those who know these two (principles)|65
Also know the ancient standard,|65
And to know always the ancient standard|65
Is called the Mystic Virtue.|65
When the Mystic Virtue becomes clear, far-reaching,|65
And things revert back (to their source)|65
Then and then only emerges the Grand Harmony.|65
How did the great rivers and seas become the Lords|66
of the ravines?|66
By being good at keeping low.|66
That was how they became Lords of the Ravines.|66
Therefore in order to be the chief among the people,|66
One must speak like their inferiors.|66
In order to be foremost among the people,|66
One must walk behind them.|66
Thus it is that the Sage stays above,|66
And the people do not feel his weight;|66
Walks in front,|66
And the people do not wish him harm.|66
Then the people of the world are glad to uphold him forever.|66
Because he does not contend,|66
No one in the world can contend against him.|66
All the world says: my teaching (Tao) greatly resembles folly.|67
Because it is great; therefore it resembles folly.|67
If it did not resemble folly,|67
It would have long ago become petty indeed!|67
I have Three Treasures;|67
Guard them and keep them safe:|67
the first is Love.|67
The second is, Never too much.|67
The third is, Never be the first in the world.|67
Through Love, one has no fear;|67
Through not doing too much, one has amplitude|67
(of reserve power);|67
Through not presuming to be the first in the world,|67
One can develop one's talent and let it mature.|67
If one forsakes love and fearlessness,|67
forsakes restraint and reserve power,|67
forsakes following behind and rushes in front,|67
He is doomed!|67
For love is victorious in attack,|67
And invulnerable in defense.|67
Heaven arms with love|67
Those it would not see destroyed.|67
The brave soldier is not violent;|68
The good fighter does not lose his temper;|68
The great conqueror does not fight (on small issues);|68
The good user of men places himself below others.|68
- This is the virtue of not-contending,|68
Is called the capacity to use men,|68
Is reaching to the height of being|68
Mated to Heaven, to what was of old.|68
There is the maxim of military strategists;|69
I dare not be the first to invade, but rather be the invaded.|69
Dare not press forward an inch, but rather retreat a foot.|69
That is, to march without formations,|69
To roll up the sleeves,|69
To charge not in frontal attacks,|69
To arm without weapons.|69
There is no greater catastrophe than to underestimate the enemy.|69
To underestimate the enemy might entail the loss of my treasures.|69
Therefore when two equally matched armies meet,|69
It is the man of sorrow who wins.|69
My teachings are very easy to understand|70
and very easy to practice,|70
But no one can understand them and|70
no one can practice them.|70
In my words there is a principle.|70
In the affairs of men there is a system.|70
Because they know not these,|70
They also know me not.|70
Since there are few that know me,|70
Therefore I am distinguished.|70
Therefore the Sage wears a coarse cloth on top|70
And carries jade within his bosom.|70
Who knows that he does not know is the highest;|71
Who (pretends to) know what he does not know is sick-minded.|71
And who recognizes sick-mindedness as sick-mindedness|71
is not sick-minded.|71
The Sage is not sick-minded.|71
Because he recognizes sick-mindedness as sick-mindness,|71
Therefore he is not sick-minded.|71
When people have no fear of force,|72
Then (as is the common practice) great force descends upon them.|72
Despise not their dwellings,|72
Dislike not their progeny.|72
Because you do not dislike them,|72
You will not be disliked yourself.|72
Therefore the Sage knows himself, but does not show himself,|72
Loves himself, but does not exalt himself.|72
Therefore he rejects the one (force) and|72
accepts the other (gentility).|72
Who is brave in daring (you) kill,|73
Who is brave in not daring (you) let live.|73
In these two,|73
There is some advantage and some disadvantage.|73
(Even if) Heaven dislikes certain people,|73
Who would know (who are to be killed and) why?|73
Therefore even the Sage regards it as a difficult question.|73
Heaven's Way (Tao) is good at conquest without strife,|73
Rewarding (vice and virtue) without words,|73
Making its appearance without call,|73
Achieving results without obvious design.|73
The heaven's net is broad and wide.|73
With big meshes, yet letting nothing slip through.|73
The people are not afraid of death;|74
Why threaten them with death?|74
Supposing that the people are afraid of death,|74
And we can seize and kill the unruly,|74
Who would dare to do so?|74
Often it happens that the executioner is killed.|74
And to take the place of the executioner|74
Is like handling the hatchet for the master carpenter.|74
He who handles the hatchet for the master carpenter|74
seldom escapes injury to his hands.|74
When people are hungry,|75
It is because their rulers eat too much tax-grain.|75
Therefore the unruliness of hungry people|75
Is due to the interference of their rulers.|75
That is why they are unruly.|75
The people are not afraid of death,|75
Because they are anxious to make a living.|75
That is why they are not afraid of death.|75
It is those who interfere not with their living|75
That are wise in exalting life.|75
When man is born, he is tender and weak;|76
At death, he is hard and stiff.|76
When the things and plants are alive, they are soft|76
and supple;|76
When they are dead, they are brittle and dry.|76
Therefore hardness and stiffness are the companions of death,|76
And softness and gentleness are the companions of life.|76
Therefore when an army is headstrong, it will lose in a battle.|76
When a tree is hard, it will be cut down.|76
The big and strong belong underneath.|76
The gentle and weak belong at the top.|76
The Tao (way) of Heaven,|77
Is it not like the bending of a bow?|77
The top comes down and the bottom-end goes up,|77
The extra (length) is shortened, the insufficient (width) is expanded.|77
It is the way of Heaven to take away from those that have too much|77
And give to those that have not enough.|77
Not so with man's way:|77
He takes from those that have not|77
And gives it as tribute to those that have too much.|77
Who can have enough and to spare to give to the entire world?|77
Only the man of Tao.|77
Therefore the Sage acts, but does not possess,|77
Accomplishes but lays claim to no credit,|77
Because he has no wish to seem superior.|77
There is nothing weaker than water|78
But none is superior to it in overcoming the hard,|78
For which there is no substitute.|78
That weakness overcomes strength|78
And gentleness overcomes rigidity,|78
No one does not know;|78
No one can put into practice.|78
Therefore the Sage says:|78
"Who receives unto himself the calumny of the world|78
Is the preserver of the state.|78
Who bears himself the sins of the world|78
Is king of the world."|78
Straight words seem crooked.|78
Patching up a great hatred is sure to leave some hatred behind.|79
How can this be regarded as satisfactory?|79
Therefore the Sage holds the left tally,|79
And does not put the guilt on the other party.|79
the virtuous man is for patching up;|79
The vicious is for fixing guilt.|79
But "the way of Heaven is impartial;|79
It sides only with the good man."|79
(Let there be) a small country with a small population,|80
Where the supply of goods are tenfold or hundredfold,|80
more than they can use.|80
Let the people value their lives and not migrate far.|80
Though there be boats and carriages,|80
None be there to ride them.|80
Though there be armor and weapons,|80
No occasion to display them.|80
Let the people again tie ropes for reckoning,|80
Let them enjoy their food,|80
Beautify their clothing,|80
Be satisfied with their homes,|80
Delight in their customs.|80
The neighboring settlements overlook one another|80
So that they can hear the barking of dogs and crowing|80
of cocks of their neighbors,|80
And the people till the end of their days shall never|80
have been outside their country.|80
True words are not fine-sounding;|81
Fine-sounding words are not true.|81
A good man does not argue;|81
he who argues is not a good man.|81
the wise one does not know many things;|81
He who knows many things is not wise.|81
The Sage does not accumulate (for himself).|81
He lives for other people,|81
And grows richer himself;|81
He gives to other people,|81
And has greater abundance.|81
The Tao of Heaven|81
Blesses, but does not harm.|81
The Way of the Sage|81
Accomplishes, but does not contend.|81
