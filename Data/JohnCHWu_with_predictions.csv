TAO can be talked about, but not the Eternal Tao.|1|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Names can be named, but not the Eternal Name.|1|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
As the origin of heaven-and-earth, it is nameless:|1|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
"As ""the Mother"" of all things, it is nameable."|1|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
So, as ever hidden, we should look at its inner essence:|1|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
As always manifest, we should look at its outer aspects.|1|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
These two flow from the same source, though differently named;|1|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
And both are called mysteries.|1|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The Mystery of mysteries is the Door of all essence.|1|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
WHEN all the world recognises beauty as beauty, this in itself is ugliness.|2|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
When all the world recognises good as good, this in itself is evil.|2|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Indeed, the hidden and the manifest give birth to each other.|2|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Difficult and easy complement each other.|2|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Long and short exhibit each other.|2|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
High and low set measure to each other.|2|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Voice and sound harmonize each other.|2|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Back and front follow each other.|2|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore, the Sage manages his affairs without ado,|2|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And spreads his teaching without talking.|2|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He denies nothing to the teeming things.|2|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He rears them, but lays no claim to them.|2|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
He does his work, but sets no store by it.|2|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He accomplishes his task, but does not dwell upon it.|2|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And yet it is just because he does not dwell on it|2|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
That nobody can ever take it away from him.|2|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
BY not exalting the talented you will cause the people to cease from rivalry and contention.|3|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
By not prizing goods hard to get, you will cause the people to cease from robbing and stealing.|3|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
By not displaying what is desirable, you will cause the people's hearts to remain undisturbed.|3|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore, the Sage's way of governing begins by|3|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Emptying the heart of desires,|3|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Filling the belly with food,|3|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Weakening the ambitions,|3|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Toughening the bones.|3|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
In this way he will cause the people to remain without knowledge and without desire, and prevent the knowing ones from any ado.|3|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Practice Non-Ado, and everything will be in order.|3|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
THE Tao is like an empty bowl,|4|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Which in being used can never be filled up.|4|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Fathomless, it seems to be the origin of all things.|4|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
It blunts all sharp edges,|4|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
It unties all tangles,|4|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
It harmonizes all lights,|4|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
It unites the world into one whole.|4|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Hidden in the deeps,|4|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Yet it seems to exist for ever.|4|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
I do not know whose child it is;|4|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
It seems to be the common ancestor of all, the father of things.|4|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
HEAVEN-and-Earth is not sentimental;|5|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
It treats all things as straw-dogs.|5|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The Sage is not sentimental;|5|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
He treats all his people as straw-dogs.|5|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Between Heaven and Earth,|5|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
There seems to be a Bellows:|5|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
It is empty, and yet it is inexhaustible;|5|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The more it works, the more comes out of it.|5|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
No amount of words can fathom it:|5|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Better look for it within you.|5|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
THE Spirit of the Fountain dies not.|6|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
It is called the Mysterious Feminine.|6|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
The Doorway of the Mysterious Feminine|6|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Is called the Root of Heaven-and-Earth.|6|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Lingering like gossamer, it has only a hint of existence;|6|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
And yet when you draw upon it, it is inexhaustible.|6|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
HEAVEN lasts long, and Earth abides.|7|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
What is the secret of their durability?|7|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Is it not because they do not live for themselves|7|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
That they can live so long?|7|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore, the Sage wants to remain behind,|7|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
But finds himself at the head of others;|7|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Reckons himself out,|7|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
But finds himself safe and secure.|7|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Is it not because he is selfless|7|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
That his Self is realised?|7|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
THE highest form of goodness is like water.|8|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Water knows how to benefit all things without striving with them.|8|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
It stays in places loathed by all men.|8|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Therefore, it comes near the Tao.|8|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
In choosing your dwelling, know how to keep to the ground.|8|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
In cultivating your mind, know how to dive in the hidden deeps.|8|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
In dealing with others, know how to be gentle and kind.|8|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
In speaking, know how to keep your words.|8|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
In governing, know how to maintain order.|8|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
In transacting business, know how to be efficient.|8|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
In making a move, know how to choose the right moment.|8|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
If you do not strive with others,|8|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
You will be free from blame.|8|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
As for holding to fullness,|9|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Far better were it to stop in time!|9|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Keep on beating and sharpening a sword,|9|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And the edge cannot be preserved for long.|9|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Fill your house with gold and jade,|9|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
And it can no longer be guarded.|9|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Set store by your riches and honour,|9|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And you will only reap a crop of calamities.|9|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Here is the Way of Heaven:|9|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
When you have done your work, retire!|9|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
IN keeping the spirit and the vital soul together,|10|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Are you able to maintain their perfect harmony?|10|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
In gathering your vital energy to attain suppleness,|10|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Have you reached the state of a new-bom babe?|10|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
In washing and clearing your inner vision,|10|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Have you purified it of all dross?|10|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
In loving your people and governing your state,|10|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Are you able to dispense with cleverness?|10|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
In the opening and shutting of heaven's gate,|10|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Are you able to play the feminine part?|10|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Enlightened and seeing far into all directions,|10|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Can you at the same time remain detached and non-active?|10|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Rear your people!|10|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Feed your people!|10|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Rear them without claiming them for your own!|10|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Do your work without setting any store by it!|10|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Be a leader, not a butcher!|10|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
This is called hidden Virtue.|10|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
THIRTY spokes converge upon a single hub;|11|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
It is on the hole in the center that the use of the cart hinges.|11|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
We make a vessel from a lump of clay;|11|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
It is the empty space within the vessel that makes it useful.|11|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
We make doors and windows for a room;|11|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
But it is these empty spaces that make the room livable.|11|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Thus, while the tangible has advantages,|11|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
It is the intangible that makes it useful.|11|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
THE five colours blind the eye.|12|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The five tones deafen the ear.|12|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
The five flavours cloy the palate.|12|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Racing and hunting madden the mind.|12|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Rare goods tempt men to do wrong.|12|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore, the Sage takes care of the belly, not the eye.|12|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
He prefers what is within to what is without.|12|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
"WELCOME disgrace as a pleasant surprise.|13
Prize calamities as your own body."|13|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
"Why should we ""welcome disgrace as a pleasant surprise""?"|13|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Because a lowly state is a boon:|13|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Getting it is a pleasant surprise,|13|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And so is losing it!|13|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
"That is why we should ""welcome disgrace as a pleasant surprise."""|13|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
"Why should we ""prize calamities as our own body""?"|13|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Because our body is the very source of our calamities.|13|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
If we have no body, what calamities can we have?|13|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Hence, only he who is willing to give his body for the sake of the world is fit to be entrusted with the world.|13|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Only he who can do it with love is worthy of being the steward of the world.|13|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
LOOK at it but you cannot see it!|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Its name is Formless.|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Listen to it but you cannot hear it!|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Its name is Soundless.|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Grasp it but you cannot get it!|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Its name is Incorporeal.|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
These three attributes are unfathomable;|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Therefore they fuse into one.|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Its upper side is not bright:|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Its under side not dim.|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Continually the Unnameable moves on,|14|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Until it retums beyond the realm of things.|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
We call it the formless Form, the imageless Image.|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
We call it the indefinable and unimaginable.|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Confront it and you do not see its face!|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Follow it and you do not see its back!|14|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Yet, equipped with this timeless Tao,|14|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
You can harness present realities.|14|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
To know the origins is initiation into the Tao.|14|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
THE ancient adepts of the Tao were subtle and flexible, profound and comprehensive.|15|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Their minds were too deep to be fathomed.|15|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Because they are unfathomable,|15|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
One can only describe them vaguely by their appearance.|15|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Hesitant like one wading a stream in winter;|15|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Timid like one afraid of his neighbours on all sides;|15|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Cautious and courteous like a guest;|15|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Yielding like ice on the point of melting;|15|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Simple like an uncarved block;|15|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Hollow like a cave;|15|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Confused like a muddy pool;|15|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
And yet who else could quietly and gradually evolve from the muddy to the clear?|15|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Who else could slowly but steadily move from the inert to the living?|15|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
He who keeps the Tao does not want to be full.|15|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
But precisely because he is never full,|15|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
He can always remain like a hidden sprout,|15|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
And does not rush to early ripening.|15|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
ATTAIN to utmost Emptiness.|16|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Cling single-heartedly to interior peace.|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
While all things are stirring together,|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
I only contemplate the Return.|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
For flourishing as they do,|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Each of them will return to its root.|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To return to the root is to find peace.|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To find peace is to fulfill one's destiny.|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To fulfill one's destiny is to be constant.|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To know the Constant is called Insight.|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
If one does not know the Constant,|16|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
One runs blindly into disasters.|16|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
If one knows the Constant,|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
One can understand and embrace all.|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
If one understands and embraces all,|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
One is capable of doing justice.|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To be just is to be kingly;|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
To be kingly is to be heavenly;|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To be heavenly is to be one with the Tao;|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To be one with the Tao is to abide forever.|16|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Such a one will be safe and whole|16|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Even after the dissolution of his body.|16|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
THE highest type of ruler is one of whose existence the people are barely aware.|17|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Next comes one whom they love and praise.|17|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Next comes one whom they fear.|17|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Next comes one whom they despise and defy.|17|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
When you are lacking in faith,|17|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Others will be unfaithful to you.|17|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The Sage is self-effacing and scanty of words.|17|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
When his task is accomplished and things have been completed,|17|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
"All the people say, ""We ourselves have achieved it!"""|17|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
WHEN the Great Tao was abandoned,|18|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
There appeared humanity and justice.|18|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
When intelligence and wit arose,|18|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
There appeared great hypocrites.|18|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
When the six relations lost their harmony,|18|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
There appeared filial piety and paternal kindness.|18|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
When darkness and disorder began to reign in a kingdom,|18|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
There appeared the loyal ministers.|18|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
DROP wisdom, abandon cleverness,|19|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And the people will be benefited a hundredfold.|19|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Drop humanity, abandon justice,|19|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And the people will return to their natural affections.|19|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Drop shrewdness, abandon sharpness,|19|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
And robbers and thieves will cease to be.|19|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
These three are the criss-cross of Tao,|19|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
And are not sufficient in themselves.|19|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore, they should be subordinated|19|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To a Higher principle:|19|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
See the Simple and embrace the Primal,|19|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Diminish the self and curb the desires!|19|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
HAVE done with learning,|20|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And you will have no more vexation.|20|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
"How great is the difference between ""eh"" and ""o""?"|20|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
"What is the distinction between ""good"" and ""evil""?"|20|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Must I fear what others fear?|20|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
What abysmal nonsense this is!|20|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
All men are joyous and beaming,|20|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
As though feasting upon a sacrificial ox,|20|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
As though mounting the Spring Terrace;|20|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
I alone am placid and give no sign,|20|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Like a babe which has not yet smiled.|20|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
I alone am forlorn as one who has no home to retum to.|20|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
All men have enough and to spare:|20|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
I alone appear to possess nothing.|20|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
What a fool I am!|20|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
What a muddled mind I have!|20|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
All men are bright, bright:|20|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
I alone am dim, dim.|20|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
All men are sharp, sharp:|20|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
I alone am mum, mum!|20|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Bland like the ocean,|20|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Aimless like the wafting gale.|20|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
All men settle down in their grooves:|20|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
I alone am stubborn and remain outside.|20|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
But wherein I am most different from others is|20|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
In knowing to take sustenance from my Mother!|20|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
IT lies in the nature of Grand Virtue|21|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To follow the Tao and the Tao alone.|21|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Now what is the Tao?|21|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
It is Something elusive and evasive.|21|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Evasive and elusive!|21|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And yet It contains within Itself a Form.|21|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Elusive and evasive!|21|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And yet It contains within Itself a Substance.|21|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Shadowy and dim!|21|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
And yet It contains within Itself a Core of Vitality.|21|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The Core of Vitality is very real,|21|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
It contains within Itself an unfailing Sincerity.|21|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Throughout the ages Its Name has been preserved|21|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
In order to recall the Beginning of all things.|21|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
How do I know the ways of all things at the Beginning?|21|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
By what is within me.|21|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
BEND and you will be whole.|22|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Curl and you will be straight.|22|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Keep empty and you will be filled.|22|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Grow old and you will be renewed.|22|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Have little and you will gain.|22|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Have much and you will be confused.|22|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore, the Sage embraces the One,|22|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And becomes a Pattern to all under Heaven.|22|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He does not make a show of himself,|22|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Hence he shines;|22|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Does not justify himself,|22|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Hence he becomes known;|22|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Does not boast of his ability,|22|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0

HIGH Virtue is non-virtuous;|38|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0

Low Virtue never frees itself from virtuousness;|38|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0

Now, ceremony is the merest husk of faith and loyalty;|38|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
It is the beginning of all confusion and disorder.|38|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0

And the beginning of folly.|38|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore, the full-grown man sets his heart upon the substance rather than the husk;|38|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Upon the fruit rather than the flower.|38|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0

Three gave birth to all the myriad things.|42|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
All the myriad things carry the Yin on their backs and hold the Yang in their embrace,|42|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0

"What is more loathed by men than to be ""helpless,"" ""little,"" and ""worthless""?"|42|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
And yet these are the very names the princes and barons call themselves.|42|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Truly, one may gain by losing;|42|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And one may lose by gaining.|42|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
What another has taught let me repeat:|42|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
A man of violence will come to a violent end.|42|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Whoever said this can be my teacher and my father.|42|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
THE softest of all things|43|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Overrides the hardest of all things.|43|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Only Nothing can enter into no-space.|43|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Hence I know the advantages of Non-Ado.|43|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Few things under heaven are as instructive as the lessons of Silence,|43|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Or as beneficial as the fruits of Non-Ado.|43|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
As for your name and your body, which is the dearer?|44|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
As for your body and your wealth, which is the more to be prized?|44|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
As for gain and loss, which is the more painful?|44|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Thus, an excessive love for anything will cost you dear in the end.|44|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The storing up of too much goods will entail a heavy loss.|44|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
To know when you have enough is to be immune from disgrace.|44|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
To know when to stop is to be preserved from perils.|44|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Only thus can you endure long.|44|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
THE greatest perfection seems imperfect,|45|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And yet its use is inexhaustible.|45|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
The greatest fullness seems empty,|45|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And yet its use is endless.|45|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The greatest straightness looks like crookedness.|45|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
The greatest skill appears clumsy.|45|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
The greatest eloquence sounds like stammering.|45|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Restlessness overcomes cold,|45|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
But calm overcomes heat.|45|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The peaceful and serene|45|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0

WHEN the world is in possession of the Tao,|46|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The galloping horses are led to fertilize the fields with their droppings.|46|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
When the world has become Taoless,|46|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
War horses breed themselves on the suburbs.|46|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
There is no calamity like not knowing what is enough.|46|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
There is no evil like covetousness.|46|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Only he who knows what is enough will always have enough.|46|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
WITHOUT going out of your door,|47|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
You can know the ways of the world.|47|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Without peeping through your window,|47|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
You can see the Way of Heaven.|47|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The farther you go,|47|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The less you know.|47|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Thus, the Sage knows without travelling,|47|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Sees vithout looking,|47|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
And achieves without Ado.|47|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
LEARNING consists in daily accumulating;|48|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The practice of Tao consists in daily diminishing.|48|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Keep on diminishing and diminishing,|48|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Until you reach the state of Non-Ado.|48|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
No-Ado, and yet nothing is left undone.|48|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
To win the world, one must renounce all.|48|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
If one still has private ends to serve,|48|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
One will never be able to win the world.|48|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
THE Sage has no interests of his own,|49|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
But takes the interests of the people as his own.|49|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He is kind to the kind;|49|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He is also kind to the unkind:|49|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
For Virtue is kind.|49|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He is faithful to the faithful;|49|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He is also faithful to the unfaithful:|49|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
For Virtue is faithful.|49|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
In the midst of the world, the Sage is shy and self-effacing.|49|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
For the sake of the world he keeps his heart in its nebulous state.|49|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
All the people strain their ears and eyes:|49|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The Sage only smiles like an amused infant.|49|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
WHEN one is out of Life, one is in Death. The|50|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
companions of life are thirteen; the companions|50|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
of Death are thirteen; and, when a living person moves|50|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
into the Realm of Death, his companions are also thir-|50|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
teen. How is this? Because he draws upon the resources|50|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
of Life too heavily.|50|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
It is said that he who knows well how to live meets|50|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
no tigers or wild buffaloes on his road, and comes out|50|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
from the battle-ground untouched by the weapons of|50|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
war. For, in him, a buffalo would find no butt for his|50|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
horns, a tiger nothing to lay his claws upon, and a|50|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
weapon of war no place to admit its point. How is this?|50|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Because there is no room for Death in him.|50|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
TAO gives them life,|51|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Virtue nurses them,|51|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Matter shapes them,|51|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Environment perfects them.|51|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore all things without exception worship Tao and do homage to Virtue.|51|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
They have not been commanded to worship Tao and do homage to Virtue,|51|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
But they always do so spontaneously.|51|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
It is Tao that gives them life:|51|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
It is Virtue that nurses them, grows them, fosters them, shelters them, comforts them, nourishes them, and covers them under her wings.|51|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To give life but to claim nothing,|51|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To do your work but to set no store by it,|51|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To be a leader, not a butcher,|51|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
This is called hidden Virtue.|51|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
ALL-under-Heaven have a common Beginning.|52|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
This Beginning is the Mother of the world.|52|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Having known the Mother,|52|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
We may proceed to know her children.|52|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Having known the children,|52|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
We should go back and hold on to the Mother.|52|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
In so doing, you will incur no risk|52|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Even though your body be annihilated.|52|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Block all the passages!|52|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Shut all the doors!|52|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And to the end of your days you will not be worn out.|52|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Open the passages!|52|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Multiply your activities!|52|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And to the end of your days you will remain helpless.|52|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To see the small is to have insight.|52|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To hold on to weakness is to be strong.|52|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Use the lights, but return to your insight.|52|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Do not bring calamities upon yourself.|52|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
This is the way of cultivating the Changeless.|52|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
IF only I had the tiniest grain of wisdom,|53|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
I should walk in the Great Way,|53|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
And my only fear would be to stray from it.|53|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The Great Way is very smooth and straight;|53|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And yet the people prefer devious paths.|53|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
The court is very clean and well garnished,|53|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
But the fields are very weedy and wild,|53|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
And the granaries are very empty!|53|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
They wear gorgeous clothes,|53|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
They carry sharp swords,|53|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
They surfeit themselves with food and drink,|53|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
They possess more riches than they can use!|53|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
They are the heralds of brigandage!|53|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
As for Tao, what do they know about it?|53|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
WHAT is well planted cannot be uprooted.|54|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
What is well embraced cannot slip away.|54|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Your descendants will carry on the ancestral sacrifice for generations without end.|54|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Cultivate Virtue in your own person,|54|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And it becomes a genuine part of you.|54|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Cultivate it in the family,|54|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And it will abide.|54|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Cultivate it in the community,|54|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And it will live and grow.|54|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Cultivate it in the state,|54|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And it will flourish abundantly.|54|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Cultivate it in the world,|54|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And it vill become universal.|54|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Hence, a person must be judged as person;|54|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
A family as family;|54|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
A community as community;|54|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
A state as state;|54|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
The world as world.|54|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
How do I know about the world?|54|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
By what is within me.|54|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
ONE who is steeped in Virtue is akin to the new-born babe.|55|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Wasps and poisonous serpents do not sting it,|55|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Nor fierce beasts seize it,|55|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Nor birds of prey maul it.|55|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Its bones are tender, its sinews soft,|55|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
But its grip is firm.|55|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
It has not known the union of the male and the female,|55|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Growing in its wholeness, and keeping its vitality in its perfect integrity.|55|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
It howls and screams all day long without getting hoarse,|55|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Because it embodies perfect harmony.|55|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To know harmony is to know the Changeless.|55|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To know the Changeless is to have insight.|55|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To hasten the growth of life is ominous.|55|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To control the breath by the will is to overstrain it.|55|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To be overgrown is to decay.|55|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
All this is against Tao,|55|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And whatever is against Tao soon ceases to be.|55|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
HE who knows does not speak.|56|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He who speaks does not know.|56|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Block all the passages!|56|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Shut all the doors!|56|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Blunt all edges!|56|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Untie all tangles!|56|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Harmonize all lights!|56|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Unite the world into one whole!|56|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
This is called the Mystical Whole,|56|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Which you cannot court after nor shun,|56|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Benefit nor harm, honour nor humble.|56|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore, it is the Highest of the world.|56|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
You govern a kingdom by normal rules;|57|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
You fight a war by exceptional moves;|57|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
But you win the world by letting alone.|57|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
How do I know that this is so?|57|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
By what is within me!|57|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The more taboos and inhibitions there are in the world,|57|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The poorer the people become.|57|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The sharper the weapons the people possess,|57|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The greater confusion reigns in the realm.|57|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The more clever and crafty the men,|57|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The oftener strange things happen.|57|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The more articulate the laws and ordinances,|57|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The more robbers and thieves arise.|57|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore, the Sage says:|57|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
I do not make any fuss, and the people transform themselves.|57|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
I love quietude, and the people settle down in their regular grooves.|57|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
I do not engage myself in anything, and the people grow rich.|57|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
I have no desires, and the people return to Simplicity.|57|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
WHERE the ruler is mum, mum,|58|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The people are simple and happy.|58|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Where the ruler is sharp, sharp,|58|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
The people are wily and discontented.|58|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Bad fortune is what good fortune leans on,|58|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Good fortune is what bad fortune hides in.|58|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Who knows the ultimate end of this process?|58|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Is there no norm of right?|58|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Yet what is normal soon becomes abnormal,|58|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And what is auspicious soon turns ominous.|58|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Long indeed have the people been in a quandary.|58|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore, the Sage squares without cutting, carves vfithout disfiguring, straightens without straining, enlightens without dazzling.|58|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
IN governing a people and in serving Heaven,|59|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
There is nothing like frugality.|59|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
To be frugal is to return before straying.|59|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To return before straying is to have a double reserve of virtue.|59|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To have a double reserve of virtue is to overcome everything.|59|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To overcome everything is to reach an invisible height.|59|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Only he who has reached an invisible height can have a kingdom.|59|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Only he who has got the Mother of a kingdom can last long.|59|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
This is the way to be deep-rooted and firm-planted in the Tao,|59|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The secret of long life and lasting vision.|59|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
RULING a big kingdom is like cooking a small fish.|60|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
When a man of Tao reigns over the world, demons|60|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
have no spiritual powers. Not that the demons have no|60|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
spiritual powers, but the spirits themselves do no harm|60|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
to men. Not that the spirits do no harm to men, but the|60|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Sage himself does no harm to his people. If only the|60|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
ruler and his people would refrain from harming each|60|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
other, all the benefits of life would accumulate in the|60|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
kingdom.|60|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
A GREAT country is like the lowland toward which all|61|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
streams flow. It is the Reservoir of all under heaven,|61|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
the Feminine of the world. The Feminine always conquers the Masculine by her|61|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
quietness, by lowering herself through her quietness. Hence, if a great country can lower itself before a|61|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
small country, it will win over the small country; and if a|61|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
small country can lower itself before a great country, it|61|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
will win over the great country. The one wins by|61|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
stooping; the other, by remaining low. What a great country wants is simply to embrace|61|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
more people; and what a small country wants is simply|61|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
to come to serve its patron. Thus, each gets what it|61|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
wants. But it behooves a great country to lower itself.|61|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
THE Tao is the hidden Reservoir of all things.|62|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
A treasure to the honest, it is a safeguard to the erring.|62|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
A good word will find its own market.|62|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
A good deed may be used as a gift to another.|62|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
That a man is straying from the right path|62|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Is no reason that he should be cast away.|62|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Hence, at the Enthronement of an Emperor,|62|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Or at the Installation of the Three Ministers,|62|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Let others offer their discs of jade, following it up with teams of horses;|62|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
It is better for you to offer the Tao without moving your feet!|62|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Why did the ancients prize the Tao?|62|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Is it not because by virtue of it he who seeks finds,|62|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And the guilty are forgiven?|62|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
That is why it is such a treasure to the world.|62|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
DO the Non-Ado.|63|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Strive for the effortless.|63|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Savour the savourless.|63|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Exalt the low.|63|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Multiply the few.|63|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Requite injury with kindness.|63|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Nip troubles in the bud.|63|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Sow the great in the small.|63|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Difficult things of the world|63|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Can only be tackled when they are easy.|63|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Big things of the world|63|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Can only be achieved by attending to their small beginnings.|63|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Thus, the Sage never has to grapple with big things,|63|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Yet he alone is capable of achieving them!|63|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He who promises lightly must be lacking in faith.|63|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He who thinks everything easy will end by finding everything difficult.|63|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Therefore, the Sage, who regards everything as difficult,|63|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Meets with no difficulties in the end.|63|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
WHAT is at rest is easy to hold.|64|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
What manifests no omens is easily forestalled.|64|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
What is fragile is easily shattered.|64|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
What is small is easily scattered.|64|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Tackle things before they have appeared.|64|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0

He who fusses over anything spoils it.|64|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
He who grasps anything loses it.|64|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The Sage fusses over nothing and therefore spoils nothing.|64|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
He grips at nothing and therefore loses nothing.|64|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
In handling affairs, people often spoil them just at the point of success.|64|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
With heedfulness in the beginning and patience at the end, nothing will be spoiled.|64|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore, the Sage desires to be desireless,|64|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Sets no value on rare goods,|64|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Learns to unlearn his learning,|64|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
And induces the masses to return from where they have overpassed.|64|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He only helps all creatures to find their own nature,|64|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
But does not venture to lead them by the nose.|64|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
IN the old days, those who were well versed in the|65|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
practice of the Tao did not try to enlighten the|65|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
people, but rather to keep them in the state of simplicity.|65|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
For, why are the people hard to govern? Because they|65|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
are too clever! Therefore, he who governs his state|65|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
with cleverness is its malefactor; but he who governs|65|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
his state without resorting to cleverness is its|65|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
benefactor. To know these principles is to possess a|65|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
rule and a measure. To keep the rule and the measure|65|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
constantly in your mind is what we call Mystical|65|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Virtue. Deep and far-reaching is Mystical Virtue! It|65|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
leads all things to return, till they come back to Great|65|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Harmony!|65|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
HOW does the sea become the king of all streams?|66|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Because it lies lower than they!|66|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Hence it is the king of all streams.|66|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Therefore, the Sage reigns over the people by humbling himself in speech;|66|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
And leads the people by putting himself behind.|66|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Thus it is that when a Sage stands above the people, they do not feel the heaviness of his weight;|66|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
And when he stands in front of the people, they do not feel hurt.|66|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore all the world is glad to push him forward without getting tired of him.|66|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Just because he strives with nobody,|66|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Nobody can ever strive with him.|66|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
ALL the world says that my Tao is great, but seems|67|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
queer, like nothing on earth. But it is just because|67|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
my Tao is great that it is like nothing on earth! If it were|67|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
like anything on earth, how small it would have been|67|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
from the very beginning!|67|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
I have Three Treasures, which I hold fast and watch|67|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
over closely. The first is Mercy. The second is Frugality.|67|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The third is Not Daring to Be First in the World. Because|67|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
I am merciful, therefore I can be brave. Because I am|67|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
frugal, therefore I can be generous. Because I dare not|67|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
be first, therefore I can be the chief of all vessels.|67|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
If a man wants to be brave without first being|67|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
merciful, generous without first being frugal, a leader|67|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
without first wishing to follow, he is only courting|67|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
death!|67|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Mercy alone can help you to win a war. Mercy alone|67|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
can help you to defend your state. For Heaven will|67|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
come to the rescue of the merciful, and protect him|67|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
with its Mercy.|67|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
A GOOD soldier is never aggressive;|68|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
A good fighter is never angry.|68|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The best way of conquering an enemy|68|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Is to win him over by not antagonising him.|68|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The best way of employing a man|68|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Is to serve under him.|68|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
This is called the virtue of non-striving!|68|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
This is called using the abilities of men!|68|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
This is called being wedded to Heaven as of old!|68|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
THE strategists have a saying: I dare not be a host, but rather a guest; I dare not advance an inch, but rather retreat a foot.|69|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
This is called marching without moving,|69|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Rolling up one's sleeves without baring one's arms,|69|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Capturing the enemy without confronting him,|69|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Holding a weapon that is invisible.|69|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
There is no greater calamity than to under-estimate the strength of your enemy.|69|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
For to under-estimate the strength of your enemy is to lose your treasure.|69|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore, when opposing troops meet in battle, victory belongs to the grieving side.|69|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
MY words are very easy to understand, and very easy to practise:|70|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
But the world cannot understand them, nor practise them.|70|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
My words have an Ancestor.|70|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
My deeds have a Lord.|70|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The people have no knowledge of this.|70|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Therefore, they have no knowledge of me.|70|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
The fewer persons know me,|70|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The nobler are they that follow me.|70|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Therefore, the Sage wears coarse clothes,|70|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
While keeping the jade in his bosom.|70|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
To realize that our knowledge is ignorance,|71|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
This is a noble insight.|71|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To regard our ignorance as knowledge,|71|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
This is mental sickness.|71|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Only when we are sick of our sickness|71|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Shall we cease to be sick.|71|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The Sage is not sick, being sick of sickness;|71|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
This is the secret of health.|71|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
WHEN the people no longer fear your power,|72|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
It is a sign that a greater power is coming.|72|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Interfere not lightly vith their dwelling,|72|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Nor lay heavy burdens upon their livelihood.|72|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Only when you cease to weary them,|72|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
They will cease to be wearied of you.|72|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Therefore, the Sage knows himself,|72|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
But makes no show of himself,|72|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Loves himself,|72|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
But does not exalt himself.|72|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He prefers what is within to what is without.|72|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
HE who is brave in daring will be killed;|73|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
He who is brave in not daring will survive.|73|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Of these two kinds of bravery, one is beneficial, while the other proves harmful.|73|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Some things are detested by Heaven,|73|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
But who knows the reason?|73|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Even the Sage is baffled by such a question.|73|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
It is Heaven's Way to conquer without striving,|73|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To get responses without speaking,|73|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To induce the people to come without summoning,|73|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To act according to plans without haste.|73|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Vast is Heaven's net;|73|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Sparse-meshed it is, and yet|73|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Nothing can slip through it.|73|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
WHEN the people are no longer afraid of death,|74|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Why scare them with the spectre of death?|74|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
If you could make the people always afraid of death,|74|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
And they still persisted in breaking the law,|74|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Then you might with reason arrest and execute them,|74|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
And who would dare to break the law?|74|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Is not the Great Executor always there to kill?|74|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
To do the killing for the Great Executor|74|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Is to chop wood for a master carpenter,|74|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
And you would be lucky indeed if you did not hurt your own hand!|74|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
WHY are the people starving?|75|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Because those above them are taxing them too heavily.|75|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
That is why they are starving.|75|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Why are the people hard to manage?|75|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Because those above them are fussy and have private ends to serve.|75|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
That is why they are hard to manage.|75|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Why do the people make light of death?|75|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Because those above them make too much of life.|75|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
That is why they make light of death.|75|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The people have simply nothing to live upon!|75|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
They know better than to value such a life!|75|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
WHEN a man is living, he is soft and supple.|76|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
When he is dead, he becomes hard and rigid.|76|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
When a plant is living, it is soft and tender.|76|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
When it is dead, it becomes withered and dry.|76|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Hence, the hard and rigid belongs to the company of the dead:|76|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The soft and supple belongs to the company of the living.|76|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
Therefore, a mighty army tends to fall by its own weight,|76|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Just as dry wood is ready for the axe.|76|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
The mighty and great will be laid low;|76|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The humbie and weak will be exalted.|76|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
PERHAPS the Way of Heaven may be likened to the|77|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
stretching of a composite bow! The upper part is|77|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
depressed, while the lower is raised. If the bow-string is|77|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
too long, it is cut short: if too short, it is added to.|77|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
The Way of Heaven diminishes the more-than-|77|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
enough to supply the less-than-enough. The way of|77|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
man is different: it takes from the less-than-enough to|77|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
swell the more-than-enough. Who except a man of|77|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
the Tao can put his superabundant riches to the|77|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
service of the world?|77|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Therefore, the Sage does his work without setting|77|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
any store by it, accomplishes his task without dwelling|77|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
upon it. He does not want his merits to be seen.|77|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
NOTHING in the world is softer and weaker than water;|78|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
But, for attacking the hard and strong, there is nothing like it!|78|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
For nothing can take its place.|78|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
That the weak overcomes the strong, and the soft overcomes the hard,|78|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
This is something known by all, but practised by none.|78|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Therefore, the Sage says:|78|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To receive the dirt of a country is to be the lord of its soil-shrines.|78|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
To bear the calamities of a country is to be the prince of the world.|78|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Indeed, Truth sounds like its opposite!|78|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
WHEN a great wound is healed,|79|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
There will still remain a scar.|79|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Can this be a desirable state of affairs?|79|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
Therefore, the Sage, holding the left-hand tally,|79|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
Performs his part of the covenant,|79|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
But lays no claims upon others.|79|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
The virtuous attends to his duties;|79|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The virtueless knows only to levy duties upon the people. The Way of Heaven has no private affections,|79|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
But always accords with the good.|79|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
AH, for a small country with a small population!|80|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Though there are highly efficient mechanical|80|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
contrivances, the people have no use for them. Let them|80|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
mind death and refrain from migrating to distant places.|80|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Boats and carriages, weapons and armour there may still|80|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
be, but there are no occasions for using or displaying|80|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
them. Let the people revert to communication by|80|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
knotting cords. See to it that they are contented with|80|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
their food, pleased with their clothing, satisfied with|80|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
their houses, and inured to their simple ways of living.|80|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Though there may be another country in the|80|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0
neighbourhood so close that they are within sight of|80|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
each other and the crowing of cocks and barking of dogs|80|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
in one place can be heard in the other, yet there is no|80|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
traffic between them, and throughout their lives the two|80|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
peoples have nothing to do with each other.|80|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
SINCERE words are not sweet,|81|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Sweet words are not sincere.|81|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
Good men are not argumentative,|81|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The argumentative are not good.|81|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The wise are not erudite,|81|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0
The erudite are not wise.|81|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The Sage does not take to hoarding.|81|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The more he lives for others, the fuller is his life.|81|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The more he gives, the more he abounds.|81|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|1.0
The Way of Heaven is to benefit, not to harm.|81|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
The Way of the Sage is to do his duty, not to strive with anyone.|81|1.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0|0.0
